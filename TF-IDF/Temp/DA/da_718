QUOTES AND IMAGES:  MEMOIRS OF COUNT GRAMMONT



MEMOIRS OF COUNT GRAMMONT


By Anthony Hamilton

With notes by Sir Walter Scott




All day poring over his books, and went
to bed soon

Ambition to pass for a wit, only
established her tiresome

An affectation of purity of manners

As all fools are who have good memories

Better memory for injuries than for
benefits

Better to know nothing at all, than to
know too much

Better to partake with another than to
have nothing at all

Busy without consequence

By a strange perversion of language,
styled, all men of honour

Despising everything which  was not
like themselves

Devote himself to his studies, than to
the duties of matrimony

Duke would see things if he could

Embellish the truth, in order to
enhance the wonder

Entreating pardon, and at the same time
justifying her conduct

Envy each other those indulgences which
themselves refuse

Every thing that is necessary is
honourable in politics

Four dozen of patches, at least, and
ten ringlets of hair

Good attendants, but understood
cheating still better

Great earnestness passed for business

Grew so fat and plump that it was a
blessing to see her

Hardly possible for a woman to have
less wit, or more beauty

He had no sentiments but such as others
inspired him with

He talked eternally, without saying
anything

He as little feared the Marquis as he
loved him

His mistress given him by his priests
for penance

How I must hate you, if I did not love
you to distraction

Impenetrable stupidity (passed) for
secrecy

Impertinent compliments

Life, in his opinion, was too short to
read all sorts of books

Long habit of suffering himself to be
robbed by his domestics

Maxim of all jealous husbands

Never felt the pressure of indigence

Not disagreeable, but he had a serious
contemplative air

Not that he wanted capacity, but he was
too self-sufficient

Obstinate against all other advices

Offended that his good fortune raised
him no rivals

One amour is creditable to a lady

Possessed but little raillery, and
still less patience

Public is not so easily deceived as
some people imagine

Public grows familiar with everything
by habit

Reasons of state assume great
privileges

Resolved to renounce the church for the
salvation of my soul

She just said what she ought, and no
more

So weak as to transform your slave into
your tyrant

Terrible piece of furniture for the
country (educated girl)

The shortest follies are the best

There are men of real merit, or
pretenders to it

They can by no means bear the
inconstancy of their mistresses

Those who open a book merely to find
fault

Very willing to accept, but was tardy
in making returns

Wealth was necessary for the
conveniencies of a long life

What jealousy fears, and what it always
deserves

What a glory would it be to have a Cato
for a husband

Would have been criminal even in
chastity to spare (her husband)
