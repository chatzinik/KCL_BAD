INTRODUCTION.


The difficulty of finding the precise Address of the Inhabitants of so
populous a city as Norwich, the general utility of a Directory, and the
spirit of Public Improvement which has of late appeared, have, at the
present period, rendered this publication peculiarly necessary.

The contents are fully expressed in the title-page, the arrangement is
adapted to every capacity, and will be found to answer every useful
purpose.

The houses in each street are all regularly numbered, beginning on the
right hand, and returning on the left, with a few exceptions for the sake
of convenience.

The boards, with the names of the streets, lanes, and thorough-fares,
which are now correctly painting, will be put up at the corner, or
entrance of each; and the whole will be completed as soon as possible.

It is with the greatest pleasure we review the many alterations for
public convenience which have been recently made: in particularâ

The Reservoir in Chapel-field, which, by the aid of a steam-engine, is
always filled, and supplies the highest parts of the city with water.

The taking down of Brazen-doors, St. Stephenâs, St. Gilesâ, St.
Benedictâs, St. Augustineâs, Pockthorpe, Bishop, and King-street Gates;
thereby admitting a current of salubrious air; and if such parts of the
wall round as are not built against were to be removed, it would be still
more complete.

The Paving of the Gentlemenâs Walk with Scotch granate.

The taking down of the cumbrous Weigh-house in the Hay-market, which
ought now to bear another title, and erecting a house for the purpose on
the Castle-Dykes, with an elegant engine, which acts with a steel-yard
under ground, and the carriage placed on the level above.

The widening of the street, now Orford-street, leading from Hog-hill to
the Castle-dykes.

The opening from off the Castle-meadow into King-street.

The levelling of the old houses at the back of Messrs. Gurneyâs, at the
foot of the Castle hill.

The new Flour Mill, worked by steam, which is erected, by subscription,
near Black Friarâs Bridge, for better supplying the city with flour.

And the new Horse Barracks, without Pockthorpe.

Not to mention the superior appearance which the Shops in the
Market-place, London-lane, and other parts of the city, now assume.

We have authority to say, that, the two Old Workhouses being in a ruinous
state, it is the intention of the Court of Guardians to apply to
Parliament for an Act to enable them to build One New and Complete
Workhouseâthe spot fixed on is the Gilden-croft.

Much has been done under the gloomy aspect of War; but from the
establishment of Peace, we ardently hope to see our native Commerce
revived, every necessary improvement carried into effect, and the
splendour of our ancient city equal to its opulence.

 _We here present our Readers with a Retrospect of the_ PROPOSED _Public
                              Improvements_.

On the 23d of January, 1800, John Herring, Esq. then Mayor, summoned a
General Meeting of the Inhabitants, at the Guildhall, to consider of the
propriety of applying to Parliament for an Act for the better paving,
cleaning, lighting, and watching of the city; for removing and preventing
annoyances and obstructions, and for regulating hackney coaches.

At this meeting, a committee of twenty-one gentlemen was appointed to
consider of the plan proposed by the Mayor, and to make a report, to a
future general meeting, of the result of its opinion.

This committee had several meetings, in which it very minutely
investigated the subject submitted to its consideration: it employed
proper persons to estimate the expence of paving a particular district,
and stationed men at fourteen entrances into the city, to ascertain the
actual number of carriages, horses, &c. of every description, which
passed and repassed during a week, that a fair calculation might be made
of the expence to be incurred, and of the funds to meet it.

The result of the labours of this committee was laid before a general
meeting of Inhabitants, on the 3d of March following, in a report, which
stated the expediency of applying for an Act for the following purposes:

I.  To empower a Deputy Mayor to be appointed in certain cases.

II.  To empower the Mayor, or the Deputy Mayor, with one Justice, to
adjourn the Sessions in the absence of the Recorder and Steward.

III.  To better regulate the watch.

IV.  To better light the city.

V.  To better regulate the sweeping and cleansing of the city.

                                                                 _Â£_
The present expence
                                          of lighting              632
                                          of watching              550
                                          of sweeping              700
                                                                  1882
The future expence, under the new regulations
proposed by the committee,
                                             Lighting     840
                                             Watching     730     1770
                                             Sweeping     200
would amount to a saving of                                        112

And on a supposition that scavengers would undertake the sweeping, &c.
for the produce of the muck, the saving would be Â£312.

VI.  To new pave the city.

The expence of the new pavement, with foot paths on each side of the
streets, the middle of the streets crowning, and the removing of all
obstructions, was estimated at Â£55,000, on an actual survey and
valuation, made by Messrs. Stannard and Athow; and this estimate was, in
the opinion of Mr. Hamerton, an eminent Paviour in London, very fair and
correct.

To defray such an apparent heavy expence, the committee, proposed levying
a toll on carriages, horses, &c. coming to and going from the city, in
the following proportions:

                                    _d._
One horse                          0Â½
Cart with one horse                1
Cart with three or more horses     1Â½
A one-horse chaise or gig          1Â½
A waggon                           2
A four-wheel carriage              2
A score beasts, &c.                2

The annual produce of these tolls, deducing the expence of Houses,
Collectors, &c. was estimated at Â£1715.

The committee likewise proposed a rate, not exceeding 6d. in the pound,
per quarter, on the landlords and occupiers of houses, &c. within the
city (exclusive of the hamlets), the annual produce of which was
calculated at Â£3000; so that the whole expence, under the proposed bill,
would have stood thus:

                                                         Â£        Â£
For lighting, watching, and cleansing                    1770
For keeping in repair such parts of the city as          1000     2770
could not be immediately paved
                                    Produce of tolls     1715
                                             of rate     3000     4715

Leaving for the immediate commencement of paving, the sum of Â£1945; which
sum would have been increased by the annual payment of a certain sum by
the Corporation, the Bishop, and Dean and Chapter, for such parts of the
city now repaired by them; and by the annual decrease of the sum of
Â£1000, in proportion as the new pavement was completed.

The committee concluded this well-digested report by stating its opinion,
that no time should be lost in applying to Parliament; but as it had
several other matters under consideration, it begged leave to be
permitted to make a final report at some future time.

The general meeting concurred, after some deliberation, with the
committee; and a petition was signed by most of the Inhabitants of the
city, for leave to bring in a bill for the several purposes mentioned in
the report.

Unfortunately, however, the petition could not, from some unforeseen
circumstances, be presented that sessions; it being a standing order of
the House of Commons, that no such bill could be brought before
Parliament, unless notice of it had been given at the preceding
Michaelmas sessions: but it was suggested, seemingly from authority, that
such notice, in the present instance, might be dispensed with, provided
the city would abandon the toll, or a tonnage on goods.

To such a restriction, the committee would not submit; it therefore
resolved to postpone the petition to the next sessions of Parliament,
and, in the mean time, that a committee of Country Gentlemen, to be
appointed at the ensuing sessions, should be requested to meet a
sub-committee of the city, to hold a conference on the subject.

This conference took place, and after a number of queries had been
proposed by the Country Gentlemen, to all of which satisfactory answers
were returned in writing; notice of the intended application to
Parliament was ordered to be affixed on the doors of the Sessions Hall,
both in the county and city.

The committee however soon found, notwithstanding it had given what if
deemed the most satisfactory answers to the queries suggested by the
Country Gentlemen, that the bill would meet with the most determined
opposition from the county; nor did it appear that the opposition could
be obviated, unless the whole expence to be incurred by any intended
improvements was confined to the city only.  With such an opposition, the
committee had no hopes of success; and whatever sentiments it might
entertain of the liberality of the Country Gentlemen, who would, with the
county at large, have materially partaken of the benefits and advantages
attending the improvements, though they were unwilling to bear the most
trifling part of the expence of them, it did not choose to hazard the
experiment of a contest.

The committee, however, had the object entrusted to it too much at heart
to abandon it entirely: it therefore relinquished all the former part of
the proposed regulations, and confined itself solely to what it deemed
the most expedientâthe New Pavement.  The Committee submitted a report on
that subject only to a general meeting, on the 15th of December, 1800,
the substance of which was, that, to carry the plan proposed into
execution, a rate not exceeding 3d. in the pound, per quarter, on the
rack-rent, should be levied on the Inhabitants of the city, at such times
only when the poor rate was within 6s. per pound, per quarter, for three
successive quarters.

At length, from considerations of the distress of the times, this truly
interesting business was deferred, but we have authority, and are happy
to say, that it will be resumed in a more favourable season.

We cannot quit this subject without observing, that the arduous and
unremitted assiduity of the Gentlemen forming the Committee, met the
warmest approbation of their fellow citizens, and afforded a prospect
that, at a future period, their labours for so desirable an object would
ultimately be accomplished.

CONCISE HISTORY OF NORWICH. {49}


Its latitude, according to Sir Henry Spelman, is 52 degrees, 45 minutes,
North: longitude, 1 degree, 19 minutes, East of the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich:âIt is 108 miles from London by Newmarket, 114 by Bury St.
Edmundâs, and 110 by Ipswich and Colchester.

It is rather more than a mile and a half in length, from King-street-gate
to Magdalen-gate; and a mile and a quarter in breadth, from Bishopâs gate
to St. Benedictâs gate.

It has thirty-four churches, besides the cathedral, chapels, and
dissenting meeting-houses; and is encompassed by a ditch, and the remains
of a flint-stone wall, begun in 1294 and finished in 1310, which was
flanked with forty towers, in the ancient method of fortification, and
had twelve gates for entrances on all sides.



THE CASTLE


Is supposed to have been built by King Canute, the Dane, in 1018; and as
far the greater number of his subjects were Saxons, who, at this period,
were the first architects, and most probably employed, it is considered
as one of the most complete Saxon remains in England.

In confirmation of this opinion, all its ornaments are in the true Saxon
style; and the bridge leading to it is unquestionably one of the noblest
and most perfect Saxon arches now extant.

The inside, instead of an open yard, was filled up with floors of most
magnificent and spacious apartments; traces of which may yet be seen by
persons accustomed to examine buildings of this sort.  On the ground
floor they were vaulted over with stone, for a great part of the old
vault still remains; also the great stone arches of the buttresses, and a
stone vaulting where the present chapel is.  It was used as a prison so
early as the reign of Henry I. but not for that purpose solely:âthe upper
apartments of these towers, were state apartments, for the residence of
great officers and their attendants.

Its length is 92 feet, 10 inches; the length of the North and South
fronts, 98 feet each: the walls are 50 feet in heighth.

Somewhat resembling the architecture of the Old, is the New Castle,
adjoining to it on the East side, built with Scotch granite in the year
1793; apparently of great strength and durability.

The Castle-Hill appears to have been raised by art, with incredible
labour: it stands nearly in the center of the city, and commands an
agreeable prospect of the surrounding buildings, interspersed with
gardens, which, with the adjacent country and river, form a most
delightful landscape.

Since the addition of the Gardens round the bottom of the Hill, strangers
have acknowledged the view from the summit to be superior to any thing of
the kind in Europe, and have justly styled Norwich âThe City in an
Orchard.â

In the Shire-House, which adjoins the Castle on the North side, the
Summer Assizes and Quarter-Sessions are held, and other county business
transacted.



THE CATHEDRAL


Was founded by Bishop Herbert in 1096, and was chiefly composed of wood,
which, by various accidents, and the turbulence of the times, was often
greatly damaged.

The present Cathedral is a fine Gothic free-stone building, brought to
the magnificent state in which it now appears by the bounty of numerous
benefactors, at various times, and completed by William Middleton, the
thirty-sixth Bishop, in the year 1284.  The roof is adorned with various
well-carved images, from the historical passages of scripture.  On the
windows at the East end of the church is most curiously painted the
transfiguration, and the twelve apostles, by Dean Lloydâs lady.

The shaft, or spire, is handsome and well proportioned.  Except
Salisbury, it is the highest in the kingdom, being 105 yards, 2 feet,
from the pavement to the top of the pinnacle, strongly built with
free-stone on the outside and brick within.  The top stone of the spire
consists of half a globe, 1 yard, 2 inches broad, with a channel round
it; whence extend eight leaves of stone, spreading outward, under which
commence the eight rows of crockets, continued down the spire, at 5 feet
distance from each other.  The weather-cock placed here at the
restoration, is three quarters of a yard high, and one yard, two inches
broad, as is also the crossbar.

The Cloister on the South side of the church is the largest quadrangle of
the kind in England, each side measuring 58 yards in length, near 14 feet
in breadth, and 16 feet, 6 inches in heighth;âthe stone roof is
ornamented with elegant carvings, representing the visions of the
Revelations, the Crucifixion and Resurrection, the Legends of St.
Christopher, St. Lawrence, &c.

At the South-West corner, the Espousals, or Sacrament of Marriage, are
carved in stone, and at the entrance of the Cloister from hence, on the
left hand, are the two lavatories, where the monks used to wash their
hands.  Over one of them is carved a fox in a pulpit, in the habit of a
secular priest, holding up a goose to has auditory, intended as a
reflection on the secular clergy, or parish priests, to whom the monks
bore an inveterate hatred.

On the North side of the Cathedral stands the Bishopâs Palace, to which
are most elegant gardens.

The Free Grammar school, near this, is a neat, spacious, gothic building,
formerly used as a charnel-house.



ST. ANDREWâS HALL,


Formerly the monastery church of the Black Friars, or Benedictine Monks,
is a beautiful structure, about 50 yards in length, and 30 in width: the
roof is supported by twelve neat and very slender pillars.  It was built
by Sir Thomas Erpingham, Knt. in 1428; and was the place where the
company of St. George used to hold their meetings of business and
pleasure.

The Mayorâs guild-feast is always held here.

Over a clock, in the center of the East end, is carved the effigies of
Justice, and underneath, the royal arms of England.  On each side, the
pictures of Queen Anne, George Prince of Denmark, Robert Earl of Orford,
John Lord Hobart, afterwards Earl of Buckenhamshire, Horatio Walpole,
Esq. Lord Suffield, and two Historical Paintings of Edward and Eleonora,
and the Death of Lady Jane Grey, by Mr. W. Martin, between which is
placed, in a splendid and emblematical frame, a highly-finished portrait
of the brave Lord Nelson, painted by Sir William Beachey, with several
Aldermen and Benefactors to the city.  The figure of St. George killing
the dragon, neatly carved, was placed here in 1686, by order of the St.
Georgeâs Company.  On the walls of the North and South ailes are placed
elegant paintings at full length, superbly framed, of those Gentlemen who
have gone through the public offices of the Corporation with dignity and
honour.

Against the further pillar on the North side, is an Ensign, 60 feet in
length, supported by a flag-staff, near the top of which is an ornamented
Shield, with the following Inscription:

                       âThe Ensign of the French Ship,
                                  GENEREUX,
                 Taken in the Mediterranean, Feb. 18th, 1800,
               By His Majestyâs Ship, Foudroyant, and Squadron,
                                 Commanded by
                                 LORD NELSON:
    The Genereux, with the Guillaume Tell, since taken by the Foudroyant,
     Lion, and Penelope, were the only Ships which escaped the memorable
      Victory obtained by Lord Nelson over the French, at the Nile, Aug.
                                  1st, 1798.

    In testimony of his Gratitude for the Honours conferred on him by the
    City of Norwich, this Trophy is presented, in the second Mayoralty of
    Robert Harvey, Esq. by

                            SIR EDWARD BERRY, KNT.
                  Captain of his Majestyâs Ship, Foudroyant,
                                    1800.â

Herein is a handsome room for the city Library, re-built in the Gothic
taste, under the direction of the late Mr. Rawlins.



THE GUILD-HALL.


In this Hall, the assizes and quarter sessions for the city are held.
Also the Mayorâs office, for the daily administration of justice; the
town-clerkâs and chamberlainâs offices: and all elections for Mayor,
Aldermen, Sheriffs and Common-councilmen are here determined.

The windows contained many stories on painted or stained glass, relating
to the administration of justice;âthere now remain perfect only one large
and two small windows, to perpetuate the remembrance of this beautiful
art.

The room is adorned with the pictures of King William and Queen Mary,
many eminent men of the county, mayors of the city, and other
benefactors.

Herein is the following inscription, suspended from a Golden Anchor, at
the bottom of which are Lord Nelsonâs arms, neatly executedâin the center
_Tria junca in uno_, on one side a Lion, on the other a Sailor, at foot
_Faith and Works_.

    âThe Sword of the Spanish Admiral Don Xavier Winthuysen, who died of
    the wounds he received in an engagement with the British Fleet under
    the command of Admiral Earl St. Vincent, 14th Feb. 1797, which ended
    in the most brilliant victory ever obtained by this Country over the
    Enemy at Sea: wherein the heroic Valour and cool determined Courage
    of Rear Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, K. B. had ample scope for their
    display.  He being a Native of Norfolk, honoured the City by
    presenting this Sword, surrendered to him in that Action.â

The City Prison is directly opposite.



ST. PETER OF MANCROFT CHURCH


Was begun in 1430, and finished in 1455.  It is esteemed a very handsome
parish church: has a fine square tower steeple, 98 feet high, though
designed at first to have been much higher, as appears from the double
buttresses reaching to the top, and the thickness of the walls: this
tower contains an excellent peal of twelve bells, cast by Messrs. Pack
and Chapman, of London, in 1775; the Tenor weighing 41 cwt.  The whole is
covered with lead, and supported by two rows of pillars, remarkably neat
and slender, forming eliptic arches at their top.

The altar-piece, representing the story of St. Peter being delivered out
of prison, was painted by that ingenious artist Mr. Catton, and presented
to the parish by Alderman Starling, in 1768.  The furniture of the altar
is crimson velvet, and the plate exceedingly grand, all but one cup being
double gilt: one piece of it is remarkably curious, being an elegant
standing cup and cover of silver, double gilt, weighing 46 oz. 1 gr. 1
pt. given by Sir Peter Gleane, Knight, whereon is beautifully chased the
story of Abigail bringing presents to David.

In the vestry hangs a neat old painted carving in alabaster, of nine
female saints, probably designed for some altar of St. Margaret, who is
the principal figure, and here represented as holding down a dragon;
among others, St. Hilda, holding a book and pastoral staff; St. Barbara,
a tower and palm-branch.  There is also an octavo manuscript bible upon
vellum, written in 1340, and a folio manuscript much more ancient,
containing all St. Paulâs epistles, with a comment.



THE NORFOLK AND NORWICH HOSPITAL,


St. Stephenâs road, is a very neat edifice: was erected in 1772, and is
still supported by voluntary contributions.

The Public Library is now kept at the building formerly the Roman
Catholic chapel, in Wymer-street, and contains 5000 volumes, where books
are delivered by the Librarian to the subscribers every day between the
hours of eleven and two, Sundays and the following days excepted, 29th of
May, 4th of June, the Guild-day, and the day preceding; 25th of October
and 5th of November.



BRIDEWELL,


Was built by Bartholomew Appleyard, about the year 1370.  William
Appleyard, his son, the first Mayor of Norwich, served his Mayoralty here
in 1403.  The North wall of this Bridewell is encrusted with cut flints,
and is seventy-six feet in length, by about twenty-five high: it is
considered one of the greatest curiosities of the kind in England.  The
flints are squared to such a nicety, that the edge of a knife can
scarcely be insinuated between the joints: most of them are about three
inches square, the surface is very smooth, and no brick-work can appear
more regular.

Several churches and other buildings in the city are thus built.

Mr. Talman says, that the Jews introduced the art of squaring flints: and
Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, Secretary to the Royal Society, in a note on a
paper of Mr. Arderonâs on this very wall, observes, that the gate of the
Austin Friars, at Canterbury, that of St. Johnâs Abbey, at Colchester,
and the gate near Whitehall, Westminster, are in the same taste.  But the
platform on the top of the Royal Observatory at Paris, which, in instead
of being covered with lead, is paved with flint after this manner, is an
instance that the French have in some measure recovered this art.  Phil.

THE THEATRE


Was built by the late Mr. Thomas Ivory, after the model of old Drury-lane
house; and in 1800 underwent an entire, elegant, and spirited alteration,
under the direction, and highly to the credit of, the present Patentee,
Mr. Wilkins.

The house now contains two circles of Boxes, with side ones on the same
tier as the Gallery.  There are Stage Boxes the same as those of
Drury-lane.  The Stage doors are semi-circular, and a Box over them, both
of these are filled with a triliage of gold and a small pilaster.  The
Boxes are supported by small reeded columns of gold, and the front of
every Box decorated with coloured Raphael ornaments, on a ground of
French grey.  At each column are lamps (patent), in the Grecian style,
suspended from an antique branch of gold, which gives a brilliancy to the
whole.  The general tone of colour is a quiet fawn, which is pleasing to
the eye, and relieves the pannels of coloured ornaments.  The mouldings
are gold and white, which give a lightness to the whole.  From the
entablature or cornice in front, descends a cove, with the Imperial Arms
in the centre, admirably executed, painted yellow, and heightened in
gold, with this motto, _Conabimur_ (we will endeavour); below this is a
rich crimson curtain, with gold fringe, supported by two statues, and on
each side of the stage doors are pilasters of gold, reeded, in which
every reed plays in the light, and produces the most pleasing effect.
There are distinct entrances to each part of the house, Boxes, Pit, and
Gallery, and the Box Lobbies are roomy and commodious.  At the back of
the upper circle is a bar-room, where coffee, tea, sweets, &c. may be
procured.

The Assembly-Rooms next it are spacious and brilliant.

There are five Hospitals: one of them, St Gilesâ, founded originally for
the entertainment of strangers, was, by Henry VIII. appropriated to the
poor of the city; which maintains 104 poor men and women, who are all
cloathed in grey, and must be sixty years of age.  Another for 16 poor
men and 8 women, whose livery is purple.  Cookeâs Hospital, in the
Rose-lane, maintains 10 poor women; and Doughtyâs, which was founded in
1687, supports 24 poor men and 8 women.  The Boys and Girlsâ Hospital
contain 30 of each, and the boys are from thence put out apprentices.
Besides 5 Charity Schools, where 111 boys and 22 girls are taught,
clothed, and supplied with books.  A number of Sunday Schools under the
care of the Rev. Lancaster Adkin, where 133 boys and girls receive every
attention, with many advantagesâand several other Charity and Sunday
Schools, on foundations, or supported by voluntary contributions from
dissenting meetings, &c. taking the whole together, educating, clothing,
&c. 300 boys and 150 girls.

The City of Norwich has local advantages superior to most cities in the
kingdom: a navigable stream to the port of Yarmouth passes through the
middle of it, with great convenience for the Wharfage and Delivery of
goods of all kinds to and from London.

It is situated on a mixed soil of ground, in a salubrious air, neither
subject to violent or scorching heat, nor to moist or watery vapours.
The upper stratum of earth is light soil, of sufficient depth for the
plough; the under stratum is chalk, gravel, and sand.

It is happily screened and defended from the Easterly winds by a
considerable rising ground, called Moushold Heath, which is higher than
the tops of the churches in the lower parts of the city.

If abounds in springs of water of the purest kind, nearly equal to the
celebrated Bristol water, supplied to the inhabitants by a variety of
public pumps.

The City is governed by a mayor, recorder, steward, 2 sheriffs, 24
aldermen, and 60 common council-men; a town-clerk, sword-bearer, &c.  The
mayor is elected by the freemen on the first day of May, and sworn into
office on the Guild-day, the Tuesday before Midsummer-day; except when
Midsummer-day falls on a Wednesday, and then the Guild is kept on the
Tuesday seânnight before Midsummer-day.  He is chosen from among the
Aldermen, is justice of the quorum during his mayoralty, and afterwards
justice of the peace for life.

The sheriffs are also annually elected, one by the Aldermen, the other by
the freemen, on the last Tuesday in August, and sworn Sept. 29.

The city is divided into twelve wards, viz. Ber-street, Colegate, North
Conisford, South Conisford, Coslany, Fyebridge, Mancroft, St. Giles, St.
Stephen, East Wymer, Middle Wymer, Weft Wymer; each of which elects two
Aldermen.

These twelve wards are again divided into four great wards;

I.  Conisford ward contains South Conisford, North Conisford, Ber-street,
with the hamlets of Lakenham, Trowse, Milgate, Bracondale, and Carrowe;
which is represented by 12 common council-men.

II.  Mancroft ward contains St. Stephenâs, St. Peterâs of Mancroft, St.
Gilesâ, with the hamlet of Eaton; and is represented by 16 common
council-men.

III.  Wymer ward contains East Wymer, Middle Wymer, West Wymer, with the
hamlets of Heigham and Earlham; and is represented by 20 common
council-men.

IV.  The Northern Ward Coslany, Colgate, Fye-bridge, with the hamlet of
Pockthorpe; and is represented by 12 common council-men.

The freemen for each ward elect Three Nominees, and the Nominees appoint
the other common council-men.

The city sends two members to parliament, elected by the freeholders and
freemen; the latter are free by inheritance, purchase, or servitude, in
number about 3000.  The freemen must have been admitted to their freedom
twelve months before they are entitled to a vote.

The Markets are on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

The decrease in the population of this City, since 1786, is 3219; but it
is to be observed that 1786 was a year of peace, and that in the returns
of 1801, those serving in the Navy, Army, and Militia, are not included.
Norwich, during the present war, has furnished, at least, 4000 recruits.

FOOTNOTES


{0}  There is no map in the copy at Norwich, although this heading
implies there may have originally been a map of some sort.âDP.

{42}  In the Norwich Millennium Library copy someone has written in a
very neat hand at the bottom of page 42: âHooke Peter, Surry St.ââDP.

{49}  There appear to have never been pages 47 and 48.  From the way the
directory is bound at Norwich the printer probably left a gap in the
pagination to cope with any last minute additions.âDP.
