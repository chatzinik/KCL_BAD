The Register of Ratlinghope.


Ratlinghope is a parish situate on the road from Shrewsbury to Bishop's
Castle, four miles west from Church Stretton and twelve miles south from
Shrewsbury, in the hundred of Purslow, rural deanery of Bishop's Castle,
archdeaconry of Ludlow, and diocese of Hereford.  The township of Gatten
is in Ford hundred.  Its area is 5,456 acres, of which 3,756 are arable
and pasture, 200 woodland, and about 1,500 common.  The population in
1901 was 197.  The surface is hilly, and the soil is sand and clay, on a
rocky subsoil.  An old Roman road, the Portway, runs between Ratlinghope
and Church Stretton, and is continued along the crest of the Longmynd in
a north-easterly direction.  In the neighbourhood are some British camps
and tumuli.

Ratlinghope, in _Domesday_ Rotelingehope, means the _hope_ or valley of
the children of _Rotel_, "Rotel" being the Saxon name from which the
County of Rutland was called.  At the time of the _Domesday_ survey,
Rotelingehope was a manor of two hides, which were waste, and was held by
Robert fitz Corbet of Earl Roger de Montgomery.  In Edward the
Confessor's reign, Seuuard had held it.  Robert fitz Corbet was a younger
brother of Roger, the builder of Caus Castle; he left two daughters, his
heirs, Sibil (or Adela), and Alice.  Sibil, who had been one of Henry
I.'s mistresses, married Herbert fitz Herbert, whilst Alice became the
wife of William Botterell.  Before 1209 Ratlinghope was acquired by
Walter Corbet, an Augustine Canon, and a relative of Prince Llewelyn ap
Jorwerth, who gave him a letter of protection.  Walter Corbet founded
here a small cell or priory of Augustinian Canons of St. Victor, in
connection with Wigmore.  Nothing is known of its history, but at the
dissolution there was a Prior and 29 Canons; and the possessions of the
Priory, valued at 5 pounds 11s. 1.5d., per annum, were sold in May, 1546,
to Robert Longe, citizen and mercer of London. {ia}

In 1845 the manor and advowson of Ratlinghope were purchased by Robert
Scott, Esq., of Great Barr, M.P. for Walsall, and at his death in 1856
they passed to his son John Charles Addyes Scott, Esq., who died in 1888,
and on the death of his widow in 1907, their son, James Robert Scott,
Esq., became lord of the manor and patron of Ratlinghope.

Stitt and Gatten, two miles north-west, were members of the _Domesday_
manor of Ratlinghope.  Between 1204 and 1210, William de Botterell
confirmed a moiety of Stitt to Haughmond Abbey.  Robert Corbet, of Caus,
also gave to the Canons of Haughmond his culture of Gateden, and an
assart situate near their culture of Gatteden.  There was a church at
Stitt in the reign of Henry II., but since the dissolution of Haughmond
Abbey nothing more is heard of it, and its district with Gatten was
annexed to the parish of Ratlinghope.  W. E. M. Hulton-Harrop, Esq., is
lord of the manor of Gatten, which, he inherited in 1866 from his
maternal grandfather, Jonah Harrop, Esq.

The Church of St. Margaret, at Ratlinghope, is a small stone building,
consisting of nave and chancel, with south porch, and a wooden bell
turret.  The original Church erected in the 12th century was no doubt the
Priory Church also.  The Rev. D. H. S. Cranage says that the mediaeval
Church may have entirely disappeared, and that there are no details which
prove that the present building is not entirely of post-Reformation date.
{ib}

The south and only door was made in 1625, and erected by Humfrey Bigge
and Thomas Bright, then Churchwardens.  The roof may be of the same date.
There are two fonts.  In 1341, Ratlinghope Church was in the Deanery of
Clun.  It was afterwards held to be in the Deanery of Pontesbury.  It is
not named in the _Valor Ecclesiasticus_ of 1534-5.  Until the dissolution
of the Priory it was considered as extra-parochial and extra-diocesan.

The Church was served by the Canons until the dissolution; and no
Incumbent seems to have been instituted by the Bishops of Hereford until
1555.  The following is the most complete list of the Incumbents we have
as yet been able to make out:--

1549.  Sir Lances Philson, clerk, curate.

1555.  Laurence Johnson, a Canon of Wigmore, presented by Philip and
Mary, and instituted 15th February, 1555.

1587.  Richard Davis, curate, presented by William Whittingham, gent.
His salary was 7 pounds 13s. 4d.

1755.  William Williams, curate.

1758.  George Hodges, born at Shrewsbury 1720, educated at Westminster
and Christ Church, Oxford, B.A. 1743.  Rector of Woolstaston 1770-1780.

1769.  David Richards, signs in 1767-70 as "Minister," and afterwards as
"Curate."

1778.  Thomas Williams.

1782.  Richard Lloyd, curate.

1795.  John Hawkins.

1833.  Edward Homfray, died 24th June, 1856.

1857.  Edmund Donald Carr, B.A. Emmanuel College, Cambridge.  Rector of
Woolstaston 1865-1900.  Died June, 1900.

1866.  William George Clutton Nottley, Rector of Alpheton, Suffolk,
1876-8.

1876.  William Henry Whitworth, M.A. and sometime fellow and tutor of
Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

1885.  Henry Anderton.  Vicar of Hopton Cangeford 1881, and of Garway
1883-4.  Resigned in 1891, and went to live at Chester.

1891.  Arthur William Benjamin Walmsley Watts, B.A. Selwyn College,
Cambridge.  Resigned 1892.  Rector of Coates, 1901.

1892.  Thomas Baker Aston, M.A. Christ Church, Oxford, Curate-in-Charge.
Rector of Habberley since 1869.  There was no Incumbent from 1892 to
1895.

1895.  William Perry Ireland, M.A. Merton College, Oxford.  Vicar of
Peter's Marland, 1897.

1896.  Thomas Robert Glenn, L.Th. Univ. of Durham.  The present
Incumbent.

The Inventory of Church Goods made 11th August, 1549, shows that there
were then at Rotlynchope "one chalyce off sylver parcell gilt, and one
cruete of pewter, one vestment of crule, one crismatory, one altare
cloth, one towell, and two bellys."  In 1553 there remained "to bellys,
[one chalice of silver] with the patent thereunto"; and another return of
1553 gives "a chales of sylver, ij belles."  The Religious Census of
Shropshire made in 1676, states that there were at Ratlinghope (in
Pontesbury Deanery) 128 Conformists, no Papists, and 3 Nonconformists.
These were the number of inhabitants over the age of sixteen.  In 1727
William Mitton was patron of the perpetual curacy.

The _Parish Register Abstract_ of 1831 contains the following account of
the Ratlinghope Registers:--

"Ratlinghope R.  Nos. I., II.  Bap., Bur., 1702-1793, Marr., 1702-1752.
No. III., Bap., Bur, 1794-1812.  No. IV., Marr., 1755-1812."  The
Registers have been very badly kept, all the earlier ones are missing,
and those of the earlier ones that remain are in a bad state of
preservation.  Nos. I. and II. are now altogether lost; they were
apparently in existence in 1876, when the Rev. W. G. C. Nottley made a
list of the Registers, and placed it in the box in which the Registers
were kept.  Sometime between 1876 and 1896 these Registers disappeared,
together with Mr. Nottley's list.

The Marriage Register 1755-1812 (No. IV. above) was formerly bound in
boards covered with parchment, but one board has disappeared, leaving the
parchment torn and crumpled, with a large hole in the centre, and the
whole book is in a dilapidated condition.  The marriage entries are on
the first twelve leaves which are loose and damaged.  It is a folio book,
containing the usual printed forms.

The Baptisms and Burials, 1794-1812 (No. III. above) simply consists of
three loose sheets of parchment, folded, making twelve pages, without any
cover.  The writing in places is nearly obliterated, and difficult to
decipher.

The transcripts at Hereford, which commence in 1660, are fairly complete,
and it would be very desirable that these should be copied and printed,
so as to make this Register more perfect.

The Registers were copied by Miss Hulton-Harrop (now Mrs. Rowan
Robinson), and were collated in 1903 by the late Rev. F. W. Kittermaster,
and have been seen through the press by the Rev. W. G. D. Fletcher.  They
are now printed, by permission of the Rev. T. R. Glenn, the present
Incumbent, at the cost of W. E. M. Hulton-Harrop, Esq., of Gatten Lodge
and Lythwood Hall, who has generously presented these Registers to the
Society.
