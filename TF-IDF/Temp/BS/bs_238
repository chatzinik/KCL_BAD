Book 51 Colossians
001:001 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,
        and Timothy our brother,
001:002 to the saints and faithful brothers{The word for "brothers"
        here and where context allows may also be correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."} in Christ
        at Colossae:  Grace to you and peace from God our Father,
        and the Lord Jesus Christ.
001:003 We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        praying always for you,
001:004 having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
        which you have toward all the saints,
001:005 because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens,
        of which you heard before in the word of the truth of
        the Good News,
001:006 which has come to you; even as it is in all the world
        and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also,
        since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
001:007 even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant,
        who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,
001:008 who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
001:009 For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this,
        don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you
        may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual
        wisdom and understanding,
001:010 that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in
        all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing
        in the knowledge of God;
001:011 strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory,
        for all endurance and perseverance with joy;
001:012 giving thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers
        of the inheritance of the saints in light;
001:013 who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated
        us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;
001:014 in whom we have our redemption,{TR adds "through his blood,"}
        the forgiveness of our sins;
001:015 who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn
        of all creation.
001:016 For by him all things were created, in the heavens
        and on the earth, things visible and things invisible,
        whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers;
        all things have been created through him, and for him.
001:017 He is before all things, and in him all things are held together.
001:018 He is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning,
        the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might
        have the preeminence.
001:019 For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;
001:020 and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him,
        whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens,
        having made peace through the blood of his cross.
001:021 You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind
        in your evil works,
001:022 yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death,
        to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,
001:023 if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast,
        and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard,
        which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven;
        of which I, Paul, was made a servant.
001:024 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up
        on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ
        in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly;
001:025 of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God
        which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,
001:026 the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations.
        But now it has been revealed to his saints,
001:027 to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches
        of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is
        Christ in you, the hope of glory;
001:028 whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every
        man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect
        in Christ Jesus;
001:029 for which I also labor, striving according to his working,
        which works in me mightily.
002:001 For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you,
        and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen
        my face in the flesh;
002:002 that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together
        in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance
        of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God,
        both of the Father and of Christ,
002:003 in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.
002:004 Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness
        of speech.
002:005 For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
        rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your
        faith in Christ.
002:006 As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,
002:007 rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith,
        even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.
002:008 Be careful that you don't let anyone rob you through his
        philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
        after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.
002:009 For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily,
002:010 and in him you are made full, who is the head of all
        principality and power;
002:011 in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not
        made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins
        of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;
002:012 having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were
        also raised with him through faith in the working of God,
        who raised him from the dead.
002:013 You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision
        of your flesh.  He made you alive together with him,
        having forgiven us all our trespasses,
002:014 wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us;
        and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;
002:015 having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made
        a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
002:016 Let no man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking,
        or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,
002:017 which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.
002:018 Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and
        worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has
        not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
002:019 and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body,
        being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments,
        grows with God's growth.
002:020 If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though
        living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,
002:021 "Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch"
002:022 (all of which perish with use), according to the precepts
        and doctrines of men?
002:023 Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship,
        and humility, and severity to the body; but aren't of any value
        against the indulgence of the flesh.
003:001 If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things
        that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.
003:002 Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things
        that are on the earth.
003:003 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
003:004 When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be
        revealed with him in glory.
003:005 Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth:
        sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire,
        and covetousness, which is idolatry;
003:006 for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the
        children of disobedience.
003:007 You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;
003:008 but now you also put them all away:  anger, wrath, malice, slander,
        and shameful speaking out of your mouth.
003:009 Don't lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old
        man with his doings,
003:010 and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge
        after the image of his Creator,
003:011 where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision,
        barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all,
        and in all.
003:012 Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart
        of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;
003:013 bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man
        has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you,
        so you also do.
003:014 Above all these things, walk in love, which is the
        bond of perfection.
003:015 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you
        were called in one body; and be thankful.
003:016 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching
        and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,
        singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.
003:017 Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of
        the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.
003:018 Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting
        in the Lord.
003:019 Husbands, love your wives, and don't be bitter against them.
003:020 Children, obey your parents in all things, for this
        pleases the Lord.
003:021 Fathers, don't provoke your children, so that they
        won't be discouraged.
003:022 Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according
        to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers,
        but in singleness of heart, fearing God.
003:023 And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord,
        and not for men,
003:024 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward
        of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
003:025 But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that
        he has done, and there is no partiality.
004:001 Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal,
        knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
004:002 Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
004:003 praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door
        for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am
        also in bonds;
004:004 that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.
004:005 Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.
004:006 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt,
        that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
004:007 All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus,
        the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant
        in the Lord.
004:008 I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know
        your circumstances and comfort your hearts,
004:009 together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother,
        who is one of you.  They will make known to you everything
        that is going on here.
004:010 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin
        of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments,
        "if he comes to you, receive him"),
004:011 and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.
        These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God,
        men who have been a comfort to me.
004:012 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you,
        always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand
        perfect and complete in all the will of God.
004:013 For I testify about him, that he has great zeal for you,
        and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.
004:014 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
004:015 Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas,
        and the assembly that is in his house.
004:016 When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read
        also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and that you also read
        the letter from Laodicea.
004:017 Tell Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have
        received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."
004:018 The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand:  remember my bonds.
        Grace be with you.  Amen.
