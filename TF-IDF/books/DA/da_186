HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES,
OF HORSHAM,
AND ITS VICINITY


The ancient town and borough of Horsham, which has generally been past
over in topographical accounts, as a place unworthy of notice; or lost in
the dazzling descriptions, of the "modern maritime Babylon of Sussex,"
must always remain a spot, dear to the lover of antiquities, and romantic
scenery.  The derivation of its name, has ever continued a matter of
great perplexity; which perhaps may be considered as a very strong
argument, in favour of the antiquity of the place.  Some persons
conjecture, that the appellation is derived from the two Saxon words,
hurst, and ham, the first syllable signifying a wood, and the second a
village or collection of houses: and this opinion seems to be supported
by the known fact, that this part of the county, was formerly one entire
tract of forest land: but again quite as good if not a superior
derivation, may be taken from the two words, Horsa, and ham, that is the
village of, or built by, Horsa.

Horsham has enjoyed the privilege of sending two members to Parliament,
ever since the year 1295: by the passing of the reform bill, however, one
representative was considered sufficient for the business of the borough.
The names of the persons first elected for the town, were Walter Burgeys,
and Walter Randolf: Robert Henry Hurst esq. is the present member.

The spring assizes for the county, had also long been held in the
Town-Hall of Horsham; but this privilege was selfishly abstracted from
the town, by the inhabitants of Lewes; and even the county gaol, which
has been stationed here, for time immemorial, is, we understand, to be
removed to the all devouring eastern rival: the quarter sessions however,
are still held here.

Still, notwithstanding, as respects the town, Horsham is greatly
improving: the number of buildings which have been lately erected, and
which are still erecting, are of a new and very handsome description: the
streets are neatly paved, with the large flat stones procured from the
excellent quarries in the neighbourhood; and the illumination of the
streets by gas, which is being carried on with great spirit and energy,
contribute very greatly to the general respectability and good appearance
of the place.

Horsham consists of 4 principal streets, crossing one another at right
angles, with a large square, stretching due N. and S., in the centre.
The upper part of this square is commonly denominated the Gaol Green, in
consequence of the prison, which formerly stood at the northern end, but
of which two large walls, now found useful in an adjacent brewery, only
remain.

                           [Picture: Town Hall]

The lower portion contains the large and handsome Town-Hall, of which the
annexed sketch will afford some idea: a few years ago, the appearance
which it presented was entirely different, being built on arches, in a
similar manner, to the Council chamber, at Chichester, and surmounted by
a stone with the inscription "Thirty six miles from Westminster Bridge,"
engraved thereupon: by the kind liberality of the Duke of Norfolk, it was
completely repaired, and greatly enlarged; and though no longer applied
to its original purpose, (except in the instance of the quarter sessions)
it is still found very serviceable for lectures, public meetings, &c. &c.
The north front is embellished by the arms of royalty, flanked by those
of Norfolk and Horsham.  On either side of the Hall, is a neat street,
only one of which is a thoroughfare; these meet on the southern side of
the building, in a very handsome and respectable walk, called the Church
Causeway, at the termination of which, is the ancient and spacious
church, (dedicated to St Mary) the approach is rendered particularly
picturesque, by an avenue of lofty lime trees, of some extent, which
leads in a perfectly straight direction, to the church-yard gateway: the
effect of the view from this avenue, is exceedingly pleasing,
particularly of a summer evening, when the rays of the setting sun cast a
beautiful golden tint, upon the venerable porch, which appears a
conspicuous object behind the portal.

                 [Picture: South view of Horsham Church]

The northern side of the edifice, though perhaps not quite equal to the
southern, appears to great advantage, though the modern windows, which
have been subsituted in several instances for others of great antiquity,
add greatly to diminish the general effect.

                        [Picture: Horsham Church]

On entering the church by the eastern gateway, the interior of the
structure appears to the highest advantage: the large and beautifully
simple communion window, reaching almost from the basement to the roof,
is by no means the least attractive object of attention; while the
handsome appearance of the altar, raised by a flight of several steps,
covered entirely with crimson cloths, the unusually large extent of the
communion rails; and the numerous beautiful monuments, in every
direction, afford a very elegant appearance, perhaps not to be equalled
by any other parochial edifice in the county.  Yet at the same time, the
venerable roof of oaken planks; the large yet highly sculptured beams
which have weathered nearly a thousand years; the tattered escotcheons;
the crested helmets; and the antique tombs, afford a view at once
pleasing and romantic.--Some attempt has been made to illustrate this
portion of the church, (the chancel) in the annexed engraving, but no
drawing can do justice to the original building.

                          [Picture: The Chancel]

The dimensions of the church are as below.

Length       146 ft.
Width        53 8 in.
Height       47 10

                           [Picture: The Nave]

The roof is supported upon wooden ribs, crossed by others of the same
materials: the joints are covered by ornamented plates of iron, of very
grotesque descriptions: in the nave, the ribs are almost double the
distance apart, of those in the chancel: the junction of the roof and
walls, in the latter portion of the edifice, are adorned with curious
little figures of horses, foxes, &c. &c. interspersed with stars, and
many other similar devices.

The entire edifice is supported upon eight columns on either side: three
constituting the chance, and the remaining five the nave: the galleries
are particularly neat, more especially that appropriated to the organ,
the whole of the pewing being covered entirely with green baize.  The
lancet windows, with which the church was formerly furnished, have almost
all been altered for others of a later date, except in the clerestory,
where they retain their original form.  The large east window, before
mentioned, was formerly adorned with no less than 14 coats of arms richly
painted.  The roof was put up, at the time that the Norfolks were lords
of the borough: in the year 1825, a curious old inscription was
discovered upon the summit of the walls, reaching from one end of the
church to the other, but it was very remarkable, that the centres of all
the letters, (which were about a foot in length) were entirely, and
apparently designedly effaced, so that not the slightest meaning could be
discovered from it.

In the chancel, is the curious and remarkable effigy of Thomas lord
Braose ob. 1396.  This noble and ancient family were formerly almost the
sole proprietors of the county of Sussex.  One of their residences was at
Chesworth, an ancient mansion to the south of the town, which shall
afterwards be described; and Bramber Castle also near Steyning,
originally appertained to these powerful barons.  The head of the figure,
"is defended by a basinet, ornamented by a draplet of jewels, his throat
by the ample carmail, attached to the helmet as in the time of Edward
III.  His arms are in plate armour, and his body in a shortened hauberk,
kept from pressing on his chest, by means of the plastron, or
breast-plate, within.  Over this is the juppon, bearing his coat of arms,
viz. seme of cross croslets, a lion rampant crowned.  Suspended from his
military girdle at his right hip, is his dagger, the sheath of which, is
ornamented in an architectural style, and in the same manner at the left,
hung his long sword, of which no traces now remain.  On his insteps, are
large pieces attached to the spur leathers, and terminated by indented
edges which conceal the chain mail beneath.  His jousting helmet,
surmounted by his crest, a demi-lion rampant, issuing from a coronet, is
under his head, but greatly mutilated, all below the oscularium, having
been destroyed." {12}

                        [Picture: Braose monument]

At a very small distance from the above mentioned monument, is a very
beautiful altar tomb of white marble, relieved alternately by slabs of
black: upon this is an admirable and most elaborately executed figure, of
a lady, in long flowing robes, her right hand reclines upon her breast,
while her left rests upon the Holy Scriptures, in a peculiarly graceful
manner: it is the work of Francis Fanelli, an Italian sculptor, of great
eminence in his day, and has escaped the devastation generally inflicted
on works of art in the parochial edifices of Sussex; the inscription is
as follows.

    Here lyeth (expecting a joyfull resurction,) the body of Elizabeth,
    late wife of Thomas Delves Esquire, son and heire apparent to Sr.
    Henry Delves of Dvddington in the Covnty of Chester, Barronet, who
    deceased the 2nd day of December 1654, being somewhat more than 25
    yeares old; then in childbed of Henry their 2nd son, who with Thomas
    their eldest son did both survive her.  She was enriched with many
    ornaments, both of mind and body, and memorable for virtue, in the
    several relations of her life, whereunto she was any way engaged,
    being religious as she was a Christian, dutiful as a daughter,
    affectionate as a wife, tender as a mother, discreete in her family
    as a Mistris, charitable in the relation of a neighbour, also of a
    sweet and affable disposition and of a sober and winning
    conversation.  She was the only child of Hall Ravenscroft Esq.r of
    this parish, by the mother descended of ye Staplays of this county.
    Her sorrowful husband, sadley weighing such a considerable losse,
    erected this monument, that an impartiall memorial of her might bee
    the better communicated to posterity.

                        [Picture: Delves monument]

On the south side, are the arms of the deceased with the motto "In Dieu
ma foy".

                         [Picture: Hoo monument]

On the other side of the church, in a portion denominated the Roffy
chancel, is a large, and beautifully sculptured altar-tomb, of Sussex
marble, with a light and curious canopy of the same material, supported
upon pillars: on the surface were formerly a brass inscription, and
armorial bearings, but all of these have disappeared, it is supposed to
cover the remains of Thomas Hoo Knt. lord Hoo and de Hastings, ob. 1455.

According to Dallaway, mention is made in the visitation book of Philpot
and Owen, A.D. 1634, of two other monuments, not at present remaining.
"Under the communion table,

    Hic jacet William Hoo armiger, qui obiit 2do mensis Sept. 1465

Arms, Hoo impaling a fess.

On a marble stone,

    Orate pro animab, Thomae Cobert et ejus uxor qui quidem Tho. ob.
    1495.

Arms, two shields, 1 Covert, impaling a phaon's head: 2 impaling, a
chevron, 2 roundlets, in chief a buck's head caboshed."

Under the organ gallery, is a curious brass of a man and woman, in the
antique dress of the time, with the following inscription, in Gothic
characters, below them.

    Here lyeth Richard Foys, and Elizabeth his wife: which Richard
    deceased in 21 day of April, MDLCIII.

Affixed to one of the columns supporting the organ gallery, is a small
slab of white marble, with a frame of black: the inscription in black
letter runs thus.

    In this seat is interred the body of Thomas Pyke Barber and
    Chyrurgeon, who departed this life the 16 day of Nov., in the year of
    our Lord MDLXXXI; and in remembrance of him, this monument was
    erected by his brother Wm. Pyke.

                         [Picture: Arms of Foys]

At a very small distance from this tablet, the annexed inscription can be
discovered upon a stone in the middle cross aisle.

    Here lyeth Robert Hvrst of Hvrst hill, who died A.D. 1483, Nicholas
    his son, A.D. 1533, and Richard son of Nicholas Feb. 16th A.D. 1592.

The other monumental inscriptions are to the following persons.

John Mitchell of Stammerham 1610, Mary his wife daughter of William
Gresham gent. of Surrey, 1610; Maurice Barrow gent. 1778; John Parsons
esq. 1702; Cecilia Maria his wife 1700; Mrs. Olive Eversfield, only

                       [Picture: Marriott monument]

The font constructed of Sussex marble, is octagonal, and handsomely
sculptured: date 1455.

                        [Picture: Font and cover]

The following inscriptions are noticed in the Burrel MSS. (British
Museum,) which at present do not remain.

                           In mortem Georgii Allen.

    Quod fuit esse, quod est, quod non fuit esse, quod esse,
    Esse quod est, non esse quod est, non est erit esse:
    Vita malis plena est, pia mors pretiosa corona est;
    Post vitam mors est, post mortem vita beata est.

In the window of the North chancel, was the following, in Gothic
characters.

    Orate pro anima, Wiliemi Attwood de Horsham et Aliciae uxor ejus,
    quae istam fenestram fieri fecit; A.D. 1428.

"Madam Eversfield (according to Dallaway) gave one silver flaggon, two
silver cups, one basin for oblation, gilt; pulpit cushion and cloth, with
gold fringe, and a branch of candlesticks to the body of the church.  Two
dozen of penny loaves, to be disposed of among the poor every Sunday,
that frequent the church, for ever; the gift of Mr Theobald Shelley."
"The same person with the Lady Matthews, gave this portion of bread to be
disposed of every Sunday for ever, for the encouragement of the poor to
frequent the church."  This is inscribed in front of the organ gallery.
In the parish registers mention is made of an attack of the plague, by
which this place was afflicted, though happily not to a very alarming
extent, they commence in the year 1560.  Over the vestry, (which was
built in the reign of Edward VI) is a very curious old room reached by
means of a spiral stair-case, terminated by a trap door: the oaken roof
depends entirely upon a large beam in the centre.  It is called the
Lollard's tower, and was most probably used as a place of confinement for
that unfortunate sect: the apertures for light are thickly guarded by
double iron bars, and in one place, on the north wall, the remains of an
iron ring are visible: the only thing of any consequence in this cold and
cheerless apartment, is a large oaken chest, curiously carved, with a
secret drawer of superior workmanship.  The beautiful service of
communion plate is also kept here.

                       [Picture: Jamieson monument]

In the Roffy chancel is the beautiful monument of Mr Jamieson; the figure
of the angel above, pointing upwards, is exquisitely sculptured, and
deserves much attention.  Dallaway mentions that there appear to have
been two chantries and a brotherhood founded in this church, whose
history is rather obscure, in some measure contradictory; the first he
adds, "was built by Walter Burgess who in the year 1307, obtained a
license to endow with 50 acres of land, a chaplain to celebrate divine
service daily in the parish church of Horsham, for the souls of himself
and his successors.  The other was denominated Butler's chantry, and was
founded by one John Body and others by the lycens of King Hen. VI, for
one chapleyn to say diligent service for ever, as th'aulter of St
Michauel in the church of Horsham; to pray for the soulles of King Henry
&c.; the said chapleyn to have for his wagis vijlr for the year, for
ever, which hath been continued accordingly till about viij yeares past,
at which time Sir Will, Brandon, clerk, then incumbent, sold the same
unto Sir Roger Copley, and after such sale by him made, he the said Sir
William, did sing after the space vj yeares, and the said Sir Roger
Coqley paid him his wagis.'"  "Horsham,--Butler's Chantry.--William
Brandon of th'age of --- yeares, was last incumbent there, but not
resident, since anno reg. xxvij who sold his interest to Mr Copley for
viijli xi s. ij d. {26}  At the west end of the building is a large massy
tower, lately put into thorough repair, this is surmounted by an
octagonal spire, 230 feet in height, and formed of wooden shingles
carefully fitted together.  The great bell of this church is the largest
in the county, and weighs nearly a ton and a half: the whole peal,
consisting of eight, is extremely melodious.

                                * * * * *

On the 17th of November 1231, John de Braose granted the church of
Horsham with all its appurtenances, to the prioress and nuns of Rusper,
for their exclusive use; by same deed it was also ordained, that on
account of the size of the parish, and the number of inhabitants, the
vicar who shall officiate in the church from time to time, shall have one
chaplain as his assistant, and two subordinate ministers, viz. a deacon
and sub-deacon, to officiate with him in the same church.  At the
dissolution of monastic establishments, in the reign of Henry VIII, the
Archbishop of Canterbury came into the patronage of the vicarage.

                         [Picture: Horsham gaol]

The county gaol is situated in East street, upon a very elevated site; it
was erected about 50 years since, by William Griffith, who ruined
himself, by contracting for the building: it is a neat and handsome
structure, and extremely appropriate for the purpose, on the South is a
small garden extending along the front of the building, which has two
court-yards, of about half an acre each, with a gravel walk surrounding a
fine grass-plot, and the whole is encircled by a lofty wall.  To prevent
confusion or danger in case of fire, every cell is arched over with
brick, and a separate room allotted to each debtor and felon.  The chapel
is in the keeper's house, where prayers are read daily, and a sermon
delivered every Sunday by the chaplain.  The annual salary of the keeper
is 180l.: that of the Chaplain 160l. and of the Surgeon 70l. per annum:
the matron and the three male turnkeys receive 8s. each weekly: the
internal management is regulated by rules made at the quarter sessions,
and confirmed by the judges of assize.

                     [Picture: Independent's chapel]

The Independent's chapel, is situated near the end of West Street, it is
peculiarly neat, both as respects its external and interior appearance:
an inscription upon an oval tablet in front, informs us, that it was
erected by voluntary subscription in the year 1814.  At the distance of
about a hundred yards from the above, is the Roman Catholic chapel, with
an embattled front surmounted by a cross: service is performed here, only
once a fortnight; proceeding on in the same direction, we arrive at the
Anabaptist chapel, a respectable building of some antiquity, a little to
the left of which is the Friends' meeting house, in a very pretty retired
situation.  The Wesleyan chapel was erected in Brunswick place, A.D.
1832, it is simple in its style, but exceedingly neat, elegant, and
appropriate: the last religious edifice in Horsham, is the Baptist's
chapel, situated in New Street, it much resembles the Independant's in
its exterior appearance.

                        [Picture: Wesleyan chapel]

"Richard Collier by his will dated Jan 23 1532, benevolently left a small
estate, at Stratford le Bow in the county of Middlesex to be sold, and
the product to be laid out in the purchase of a school house at Horsham,
where he was born." {31}  The children enjoying the privileges of this
charity, are annually selected by the vicar and churchwardens with eight
of the most "honest" inhabitants, they are allowed to remain till the age
of 14 and any number may at the discretion of the school wardens, be
instructed in the Latin language.  It is expressly ordered in the will,
that the children elected, should be the offspring of "poor people, in
especial of the said parish, and next about the same, to be educated in
reading, writing, arithmetic, and the principles of the Christian
religion."  The charitable founder also bequeathed to the Mercers'
Company, a house and premises in Cheapside London, for the support of the
master and usher, whose annual salaries are, 120l. for the former, and
80l. for the latter.  The school house is situated in a peculiarly
delightful and romantic situation, with a pleasant croft in front,
extending to the east side of the church yard; the accompanying wood-cut
represents the west front of the building.

                      [Picture: The British Schools]

The National School is held in the church porch, where great numbers of
the younger children of the poor are instructed.

A very neat building, denominated Denne School, has been erected in a
delightful situation, at the foot of the hill, from which it takes its
name, for the education of the girls of the neigbouring indigent persons.

In the back lane, the members of the church of England, have instituted
an infant school, which appears a very pleasant object in this hitherto
neglected portion of the town.

The Royal British Schools are also well worth the inspection of the
visitor: the boys are taught reading, writing, grammar, linear and
perspective drawing &c.

To the North of Horsham, on Hurst hill, is Moated House, formerly
belonging to the family of the Westons: this mansion was the residence of
Robert Hurst ob. 1483, whose monument in the church, the reader will
remember.

                         [Picture: North Chapel]

Nearer the town, is a very ancient building formerly belonging to lord
Hoo and de Hastings, whose remains are interred in the church: a farm
house at present the property of the duke of Norfolk alone marks the site
of this once splendid and princely edifice.

                        [Picture: Chesworth House]

Chesworth, one of the oldest houses in the county, was formerly as before
said, the residence of the noble family of Braose, this truly romantic
structure is situated a little to the south east of the town, of which it
is one of the chief objects of interest.  The unfortunate Thomas duke of
Norfolk, who fell a victim to the malignant jealousy of Queen Elizabeth,
was apprehended here, A.D. 1571.  It is said that the papers concealed by
Higford, and which led to his conviction, were discovered under the roof
of this building.  Several apartments of very spacious dimensions, but of
whose existence the inhabitants were totally ignorant, were discovered
through accident, by a maid servant about 20 years since.  The chapel now
used as a wash-house, is still quite perfect, and of great height:
several niches for the statues of saints, and receptacles for holy water,
may be discovered in the sides: through the falling of part of the wall,
a few years ago, several Roman coins were dug up, from which
circumstance, it has been by some persons imagined, that the place was
originally a Roman villa.

To the west of the town, is Hills place, or rather the remains of an
elegant residence, so called; it was formerly the property of the lords
Irvine, and was considered a very handsome specimen of the domestic
architecture of the age, in which it was erected.  It was taken down a
few years since, and no vestige left to mark its site, save the remnants
of a farm house in existence before the building of the mansion itself,
and part of a wing added to the structure, on the marriage of lord
William Ingram, one of the family.

                       [Picture: Hills place, 1787]

In one of the upper rooms, is a venerable escocheon, with the motto "In
coelo quies," serving to exclude the wind from the antique chamber.

On a lofty eminence denominated Denne hill, the visitor may obtain a very
beautiful view of the town of Horsham, with its adjacent hills behind,
the interesting church appears by far the most conspicuous object in the
wide extended landscape, while the small and winding branch of the river
Arun, which takes its rise in the adjacent forest of of St. Leonard,
contributes not a little to heighten the beauty, and diversify the scene,
of this truly delightful and extensive prospect.

At a short distance from the spot where this romantic view may be
obtained, the ivied tower, and venerable battlements of Denne house,
proudly rise upon the sight.  The spot upon which this edifice stands, is
particularly interesting, being generally supposed by antiquarians to be
the site of a Danish encampment, during a conflict with the Picts, who
made choice of an opposite eminence, still retaining the name of Pict's
hill, while the one we have just described preserves the appellation of
Denne (undoubtedly derived from Dane) hill.  The estate formerly
belonging to the family of Braose, was forfeited to the crown, with other
lands, on the attainder of Thomas duke of Norfolk into whose possession
it had fallen: in the year 1594, it was awarded by Sir William Covert and
Sir John Caryll to James Boath, by whom it was sold five years afterwards
to Stephen Barnham of London for 1250l.  Shortly afterwards however the
two sons of the last mentioned person, parted with it to Sir Thomas
Eversfield for the sum of 5500l.

                          [Picture: Denne House]

After passing through the hands of several of his descendants, it
devolved to William Markwick esq, who took the name of Eversfield, and to
whose grandson a minor it now belongs.

                        [Picture: Warnham Church]

Continuing along the London road from Horsham for about 3 miles and then
pursuing the road to the left, we arrive at the picturesque, secluded,
and delightful little village of Warnham, bounded on the east by Rusper,
west by Slinfold, south by Itchingfield, and north by Capel, and
containing in 1831, 952 inhabitants.  The village is lather extensive,
and consists principally of one long narrow street, running N. and S.,
the church on the west side is particularly neat, though exhibiting a
variety of style, and consists of a nave and south aisle, with three
chancels: the northern of these latter portions is divided from the south
aisle, by a handsome oaken skreen, carved in the Gothic style, and
formerly belonged to the Carylls.  On the north side is a curious old
mural monument, bearing the effigies of a man in armour and a woman
kneeling; below are 8 smaller figures intended for their children, with
another person armed, in the centre.  The inscription informs us that it
was erected to the memory of Sir John Caryll Knt., eldest son of Thomas
Caryll esq. of Warnham, and Maria his wife, daughter of George Cotton of
Warblington, ob. 1613.  The south chancel belonged to the Mitchell family
of Field Place, and contains monuments to the memory of Mary Mitchell
widow, mother of Edward Shelley esq., by Sir Timothy Shelley gent, ob.
1731; John Mitchell gent. 1711: John Shelley esq. 1799; Mary his wife
1759: Edward Shelley esq., of Field place 1747.  The centre chancel,
formerly belonging to the appropriation, is at present, in conjunction
with the other two, the property of Sir Timothy Shelley Bart.  In the
body of the church are slabs to Samuel Shuckford, 45 years vicar of
Warnham and Eartham, Ann his widow, and Matthew Napper gent.  In the
pavement of the south aisle, the side of an altar tomb, adorned with
shields and quatrefoils, and apparently of the time of Edward I, may be
discerned: the font is square, and of the same date; the pulpit stands
upon a basement of brick, which gives it a particularly singular
appearance: the neat embattled tower contains five bells, and is of later
construction than the rest of the building.

                  [Picture: Monument of Sir John Caryl]

Warnham Court, a handsome mansion in the style of Elizabeth, and a very
striking feature of the surrounding country, was erected about three
years since, by Henry Tredcroft esq.: the house contains about 50
apartments, and is built of brick faced with stone: the grounds are
tastefully arranged, and the park, though so recently laid out, assumes a
beautiful and verdant appearance.

                         [Picture: Warnham Court]

To the south of Warnham, is Field Place, the residence for several
centuries of the family of Mitchell.  The only daughter of the Rev.
Theobald Mitchell, married the late Sir Bysshe Shelley, by whose son Sir
Timothy, it is now possessed.  Percy Bysshe Shelley, the celebrated poet
and friend of Byron, was born here: a brief but interesting account of
his life, may be found in Horsefield's "History of Sussex" vol. 2nd.
under the description of Warnham.

                          [Picture: Field place]

To the east of Horsham, is a tract of land, containing between eight and
nine thousand acres, called St. Leonard's forest: although its nearest
point is seven miles from the upper part of Beeding, it is within the
limits of that parish: the chief part of the soil is poor, it contained
considerable quantities of iron stone, which was smelted, but as the
timber became exhausted, the smelting of the iron has been long
discontinued, and nothing remains to denote the former manufactory of
cast iron, but several large ponds in various parts of the forest, still
called Hammer ponds.

This forest has ever been the subject of the legends of neighbouring
peasants, woe (according to their account) to the luckless wight, who
should venture to cross it alone on horseback during the night, for no
soon will he have entered its darksome precincts, than a horrible
decapitated spectre in the shape of a former squire Paulett, disregarding
all prayers or menaces, leaps behind him on his good steed, and
accompanies the affrighted traveller to the opposite boundaries.--The
celebrated St. Leonard also, through whose efficacious prayers

    "The adders never stynge,
    Nor ye nyghtyngales synge,"

in its gloomy mazes is often the theme of the cottagers fire side
conversation.

But neither ghost, nor cast iron, nor saint Leonard himself, have gained
for this forest so much celebrity as its famous DRAGON, or serpent!  This
venemous reptile, which some persons have rendered into some obnoxious
proprietor, has been honoured with a long and minute description in the
following account.

    "True and wonderful, A discourse relating to a strange monstrous
    serpent or dragon, lately discovered, and yet living to the great
    annoyance and divers slaughters both of men and cattle by his strong
    and violent poyson, in St. Leonard's forest, and thirtie miles from
    London, this present month of August, 1614, with the true generation
    of serpents.  Printed at London by John Trundle 1614.

    In Sussex there is a pretty market towne, called Horsam, neare unto a
    forest called St Leonard's forest, and there in a vast unfrequented
    place, heathie, vaultie, full of unwholesome shades and overgrown
    hollowes, where this serpent is thought to be bred; but wheresoever
    bred, certaine and too true it is, that there it yet lives.  Within
    three or four miles compass are its usual haunts, oftentimes at a
    place called Faygate, and it hath been seene within half a mile of
    Horsam, a wondre no doubt most terrible and noysome to the
    inhabitants thereabouts.  There is always in his tracke or path, left
    a glutinous and slimy matter (as by a small similitude we may
    perceive in a snail) which is very corrupt and offensive to the
    scent, in so much that they perceive the air to be putrified withall,
    which must needs be very dangerous: for though the corruption of it
    cannot strike the outward parts of a man, unless heated into blood,
    yet by receiving it in at any of our breathing organs, (the nose or
    mouth) it is by authority of all authors writing in that kinde,
    mortal and deadlie; as one thus saith,

    'Noxia serpentum est admixto sanguine pestis.--LUCAN.'

    The serpent, or dragon as some call it, is reputed to be nine feete
    or rather more, in length, and shaped almost in the forme of an
    axle-tree of a cart, a quantitie of thickness in the middest, and
    somewhat smaller at both ends.  The former part which he shootes
    forth as a necke, is supposed to be about an ell long, with a white
    ring as it were of scales about it.  The scales along his backe,
    seeme to be blackish, and so much as is discovered under his bellie,
    appeareth to be red: for I speak but of no nearer description than a
    reasonable ocular distance; for coming too neare, it hath already
    been too dearely paid for, as you shall heare hereafter.  It is
    likewise discovered to have large feete, but the eye may be deceved,
    for some suppose that serpents have no feete, but glide along upon
    certain ribbes and scales, which both defend them from the upper part
    of the throat unto the lower part of their bellie, and also cause
    them to move much the faster.  For so this doth, and rids away as we
    call it, as fast as a man can run.  He is of countenance very proud,
    and at the sight or heareing of men and cattle, will raise his necke
    upright, and seem to listen and looke about with great arrogancie.
    There are likewise on either side of him discovered two great
    bunches, so big as a large footeball, and as some think will grow to
    wings, but God I hope will so defend the poor people in the
    neigbourhood, that he shall be destroyed, before he growe so
    fledge.--He will cast his venome about 4 roddes from him, as by
    woeful experience it was proved on the bodies of a man and woman
    coming that way, who afterwards were found dead, being poysoned and
    very much swelled, but not preyed upon.  Likewise a man going to
    chase it and as he imagined to destroy it with two mastiff dogs as
    yet not knowing the great danger thereof, his dogs were both killed,
    and he himself glad to returne with haste to preserve his own life:
    yet this is to be noted that the dogs were not preyed upon, but
    slaine and left whole, for his food is thought to be for the most
    part in a conie warren, which he often frequents, and it is found to
    be much scanted and impaired, in the encrease it had wont to
    afford.--These persons, whose names are here under printed, have
    scene this serpent, besides divers others, as the carrier of Horsam,
    who lieth at the White Horse, in Southwark, and who can certifie the
    truth of all that hath been herein related.--

                                                             "John Steele,
                                                      "Christopher Holder,
                                  "And a widow woman dwelling at Faygate."

Previously to the reformation, St. Leonard's forest contained two
chapels, one of which is mentioned as early as the year 1320.  No traces
of either remain at the present day.

                                * * * * *

Proceeding from Horsham along the London road, and passing Thornton
ville, a collection of houses lately erected by the person resident at
Springfield, we arrive at Coolhurst, the delightful and elegant mansion
of the Marchioness of Northampton: the vicinity of this seat was lately
rendered particularly interesting by a romantic and beautiful glen called
Dubbin's Green, one of the wildest and most secluded spots in the
district, but it is greatly to be lamented, the enclosing of the adjacent
common, has almost entirely destroyed the beauty of the scenery, and
robbed the visitor of a truly rural and picturesque treat.  Continuing
along the turnpike road for some distance, and then inclining to the
right, the pretty little village of Nuthurst, with its modest spire
peeping amidst the lowly cottages which constitute the single street is
display before the sight.  To the east of the parish is a portion of St.
Leonard's forest, and a part of the parish of Cowfold: to the west
Horsham, and part of Broadwater; to the north another portion of the
forest; and south Cowfold.  The district is peculiarly rich and
beautiful, abounding in springs of excellent water in every direction.
The church, of the time of Edward III, and dedicated to St. Andrew, is in
the early style of English architecture, with a low tower, containing 3
bells, and surmounted by a low shingled spire, at the west end.  The roof
is pannelled in a similar manner to the church at Horsham; the ribs and
knots of two pannels are gilt and painted.  The communion window contains
remnants of stained glass, representing the Salvator Mundi, and two
angels scattering incense.  The monumental inscriptions are to the memory
of Joseph Tuder esq. of Sedgewick park, 1774: Rebecca Nelthorpe his
niece, 1784; William Nelthorpe esq., 1791: Elizabeth Nelthorpe 1801;
Eliza Sarah wife of James Tuder Nelthorpe esq. of Nuthurst lodge, died at
Paris 1826, and was interred in the cemetry of Pere la chaise; John
Aldridge of New Lodge, 1803: John Warburton Aldridge son of the above,
1801: Samuel Aldridge 1773: Sophia Aldridge 1769.  The font is plain and
octagonal.

                        [Picture: Nuthurst Church]

Near Nuthurst in a very delightful situation, commanding extensive views
of the sea and south downs, is Nuthurst Lodge, the residence of James
Tuder Nelthorpe esq.: at a very short distance from the mansion, are the
remains of an ancient castle or hunting seat, surrounded by an oute and
inner moat, of a circular form, and traceable everywhere; the foundations
of the walls are quite visible, and one apartment of a sexagonal shape is
entirely perfect.  About 40 yards farther on, surrounded by copse wood,
and over hanging trees, is a small well of a circular form, and
surrounded by cut stone overgrown by moss: a flight of winding steps,
leading to it, from an adjacent eminence, adds a peculiarly romantic and
pleasing effect to this venerable work of antiquity, which is known by
the name of the Nun's Well.  No account is to be found of its history,
though it may perhaps have belonged to the neighbouring castle.  The
traditions among the inhabitants affirm, that a subterraneous passage
connects this castle with the nunnery at Rusper, which is 8 miles
distant, but no attempt has been undertaken to ascertain the truth of
this conjecture.  Passing over Tower Hill, an eminence near Horsham, we
arrive at the village of Itchingfield, or Hethinfield as it was formerly
called.  The earliest notice of this place, is to be found in an ancient
deed A.D. 1233, when "Hugh de Mabel and Susanna his wife, sold to Robert
atte Feching, one messuage and half a carucate of land, at Hethinfield."
The parish is bounded on the east by Horsham, south by Shipley, west by
Shipley, and north by Slinfold, and contained in 1831, 349 inhabitants.
The church dedicated to St. Nicholas is of the time of Henry III, or
Edward the I.  Its exterior is particularly rustic especially the low
tower at the west end, which is formed of entire trunks of trees fastened
together by wooden bolts.  Against one of the walls of timber in the
belfry is an ancient painting representing Moses receiving the ten
commandments on mount Sinai, it was most probably used as a kind of altar
piece.

                      [Picture: Itchingfield Church]

In the chancel is a mural monument to the memory of Richard Wheatly gent,
ob. 1668, and some members of his family, who were nearly allied to the
Mitchells of Field place.  There is also another inscription to the
memory of the Rev. Alexander Hay, former rector of the parish, 1724, also
several of his children.  Dallaway mentions that after the Scotch
rebellion in 1715, some of the attained persons took refuge in the woods
of Itching field, and were permitted to reside with their countryman
Alexander Hay; indeed we can hardly imagine a more suitable place for
concealment, than the parsonage house, situated as it was at that time,
in the centre of a dense forest, through which there was hardly any
passable road.

The last monumental inscription is for the Rev. Thomas Lavender a most
exemplary minister of this parish, for upwards of 60 years, he died in
the year 1776, at the age of 86.

The font is modern, but particularly neat and handsome; one of a very
ancient description, was lately dug up in the churchyard.

                        [Picture: Farthing Bridge]

Proceeding along the turnpike road to the west of Horsham and passing
Farthing Bridge, of which the annexed wood-cut is a representation, we
reach Broad-bridge Heath, a delightful, picturesque, and salubrious
plain, so called: by pursuing the centre road, the visitor will arrive at
Stroud, a small hamlet about 3 miles from Horsham; it is chiefly
remarkable for the elegant residence denominated Stroud park, belonging
to --- Commerell esq.: the grounds around the house particularly deserve
attention, and the sweetly retired situation of the fishing house,
erected upon the banks of a lake surrounded by the majestic and noble
trees for which this district is so justly celebrated, whilst the deep
silence which pervades the whole, interrupted only by the rippling stream
beneath, and the delightful choir of the feathered songsters, combine to
render it, in every sense of the word, a most enchanting and delightful
scene.

                        [Picture: Slinfold Church]

By taking the road to the left hand, on Broad-bridge heath, and again
turning to the right at Lion's Corner gate, the village of Slinfold, to
which the hamlet of Stroud belongs, soon appears in sight.  "Fold"
observes Mr. Dallaway, "is a termination frequently belonging to parishes
within the weald and in distinction to Hume seems to be applied to those
which were first cultivated in square inclosures, after the removal of
timber and underwood.  This observation belongs to the early Saxon aera;
and it is evident that the name of almost every vilor or farm within the
district is derived from them."  The church build at the end of the
village, was erected at the formation of the parish by bishop Ralph in
1230.  It has a nave and north aisle with a small sepulchral chapel
appendant.  In this portion of the church which belongs to the manor of
Dedisham, is a curiously sculptured female figure, destitute of any
inscription, but traditionally said, to belong to a member of the family
of Tregoz.--There are also two other mural monuments, with small painted
alabaster effigies of women in the ancient dress of their times.  The
first of which we give a sketch, appears particularly "en bon point," and
is represented kneeling on a cushion, in the act of prayer.  The
following inscription, now almost illegible, appears beneath.

       [Picture: Tregoz monument] HERE LIETH KATHARINE BLOUNT, YOUNGEST
      DAUGHTER OF RICHARD BLOUNT ESQ., OF DEDISHAM, (DESCENDED FROM SIR
    WALTER BLOUNT KNT.  LORD MOUNTJOY) AND MARY WIFE TO THE SAID RICHARD,
     DAUGHTER TO SIR WILLIAM WESTE, KNT., LORD DE LA WAR, WHICH KATHARINE
     DECEASED MARCH 1, 1617, IN THE 27TH. YEAR OF HER AGE.  SHE LEFT HER
      ESTATE TO HER 4 SISTERS, VIZ. ELIZABETH, ANN, MARTHA, AND JANE, TO
                WHOSE PIOUS MEMORY THEY ERECTED THIS MONUMENT.

The remaining monument is to the memory of mistress Jane Blount, ob.
1614.

                        [Picture: Blount monument]

In the pavement is a large slab of Sussex marble, with an inscription to
the memory of Richard Bradbridge gent., and Denys his wife, with their
children, ob. 1633.

The tower is massive, and like all those in the Weald, surmounted by a
spire of shingles, supported upon four upright beams of a length and
diameter very seldom seen.

This parish which is bounded on the east by Warnham, west by Rudgewick
and Billinghurst, north by Rudgewick, and south by Itchingfield,
approaches nearer in form to a circle than any other, and is intersected
in several directions by 3 turnpike roads.  From the excellent slate
quarries in the vicinity, slabs containing 100 square feet, and about 5
in thickness have often been raised.  Several rare botanical plants are
found in this parish, some indigenous, and others originally introduced
by Dr. T. Manningham a former rector, well versed in that science.

The late eminent antiquary Mr. Warton, observes in his history of
Kiddington, page 65, "About 5 years ago, (1775) on the edge of a lane in
the parish of Slinfold in Sussex, four miles from Horsham, I saw several
deep fissures in the Stane street, a Roman road, going from Arundel, if
not from the sea side through Dorking to London.  The dorsum not intended
for heavy carriages consists of sea gravel and sea pebbles abounding on
the Sussex coast, above 3 feet deep, and 7 yards long: these minute
materials must have been amassed with prodigious labour.

Springfield, a handsome brick mansion to the north of the town, is the
property of Francis Scawen Blunt esq., who now rents it to --- Thornton
Esq.

COACHES.


Coaches pass daily to and from London, Brighton, Worthing, Windsor,
Oxford, and Reading.--The Horsham and London Star Coach leaves the Swan
inn West Street, at 7 o'clock every morning, and reaches the old Bell inn
Holborn about a quarter to 12: from thence it starts the same afternoon,
at a quarter past 3, and arrives at Horsham by 8.




GAS.


The streets are now well lighted with gas, considering that this is the
first year of their illumination.  The gameter is erected at the back of
Albion Terrace, another specimen of the improving state of the town.  The
good people of Horsham have lately been much annoyed by the dirty
condition of their streets, occasioned by the insertion of the gas pipes,
even to such an extent as almost to merit the ancient epithet of the
county, as we find in a very old verse, or rather ryhme of the
peculiarities of each shire.

SAURIAN REMAINS.


The strata around Horsham, (which is situated in the Wealden formation)
are celebrated for the abundance of the exuviae, of large saurian
animals.--Many of the bones of the Iguanadon, an enormous reptile, which
was formerly an inhabitant of these districts, are now in the possession
of Mr G. B. Holmes, of Horsham, by whom these particulars are obligingly
communicated.  The animal which more nearly approximates to it, than any
other now in existence, is the Iguana Cornuta a native of the tropical
parts of America, and from its resemblance to which it has received its
name; but more particularly on account of the teeth of the Iguanadon,
which resemble those of no other animal than the Iguana, of which one
species (the Cornuta,) has, like the Iguanadon, a single horn.  If we
take the Iguana as our model, and attempt to reconstruct the enormous
Iguanadon in just proportion, from the relics which have been frequently
exhumed, we shall produce a monster 100 feet in length, which there is
every reason to believe is not an exaggeration.--Besides the Iguanadon,
we find the bones of the crocodile, the Plesiosaurus, the turtle, and
other amphibious reptiles; with the carbonized remains of
monocotyledoneous plants, arborescent ferns, and palms, &c.

                        [Picture: Map of Horsham]




WATER.


The water around Horsham is of a very superior quality, and extremely
abundant.  It is intended shortly to supply each house by means of pipes.
At Tower Hill, is a spring, by whose waters every thing over which it
passes is encrusted, in consequence of its depositing a small portion of
carbonate of lime, with which it is impregnated in passing the limestone
strata, through which it flows.




POPULATION


The population of Horsham, has of late years greatly increased, and at
present amounts to nearly 6000.  The following table will afford a view
of its advance during the present century.

1801       3204
1811       3839
1821       4575
1831       5105

ROADS.


Horsham, though at present remarkable for the excellent state of its
turnpike roads, was, before the year 1750, one of most extraordinary
instances of non communication in the kingdom: previously to the
abovementioned period, the London road was so execrably bad, that whoever
went there on wheels, was compelled to go round by Canterbury!

It is intended to make the great London and Brighton rail road pass
through the town, which cannot fail to encreas the business and traffic
of the place.




FAIRS.


The fairs of Horsham are on April 5th: Monday before Whitsunday, sheep
and lambs: July 18th cattle and pedalary; the Cherry fair; Sep. 5th.
cattle: Nov. 27th. cattle and toys.  Last Tuesday in every month, for
cattle.

"Nicholas Hostresham, whose name is contracted to Horsham, may justly be
placed in this town, as descended from it; families of note often taking
their names from their places of residence; and if that be admitted, he
will give some lustre to it, for he was a very learned man, and so famous
a physician, that the nobility coveted his company on any conditions, so
high an esteem had they for him.  It seems it was something of a peculiar
art in him, to cure and yet to please his patient, which he would not do
nevertheless it was consistent with the disease; for his aim was, to cure
and please if possible, but displease if unavoidable.  He was of a middle
temper, neither so rough as to affright, nor so gentle, as to humour his
patient into his own destruction; so that he was almost two physicians in
one man.  He died in the year 1448."

APPENDIX


Having principally confined the limits of the foregoing account, to a
circle of about 4 or 5 miles around the town of Horsham, we have omitted
previously to notice the priory of Rusper, a building of great antiquity,
and closely connected with that borough, by the endowment of the church
to its nuns.  Very little of the ancient edifice remains at present, I
shall therefore insert a very brief account of the nunnery, as given by
Sir William Burrell, in his interesting MSS. preserved in the British
Museum.

"On the north wing of the east front of the nunnery, towards the orchard,
the foundations of additional building, and the arch of a cellar are
visible, 58 feet in extent, and east of the present house.  It is
probable a similar wing was on the south aspect and thereby formed a
Greek II.  The ancient apple trees which cover the flank, render such an
idea very problematical."  Near the building is a very deep well, said to
have been used as a place of destruction for those members of the
convent, who had dared to break their vows of chastity.

Near Mrs Delves tomb at Horsham, is the headless brass figure of an
ecclesiastic, supposed from the letters T C in the cope, to cover the
remains of Thomas clerk, a former rector.
