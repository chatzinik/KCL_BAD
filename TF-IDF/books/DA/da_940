MEMOIR.


MR. BRAY was born at Shere, on the 15th of November, 1736.  He was the
youngest of the three sons who survived their father Edward Bray, Esq.
George the eldest, who was in the Church, and the second son Edward, who
was in the Army, both died unmarried; and, on the death of George the
survivor, in 1803, Mr. Bray succeeded to the possession of the Manors of
Shere and Gumshall, which had belonged to his ancestors from the reign of
Henry the Eighth.  When ten years old he was placed at Rugby, where he
remained until he was articled to Mr. Martyr, an Attorney of Guildford.
In 1761, he was appointed a Clerk of the Board of Green Cloth, at St.
Jamesâs, through the patronage of Sir John Evelyn.  His attendance at the
Board did not prevent his practising as an Attorney, and it introduced
him to many clients.  In 1777, he published a âTour in Derbyshire and
Yorkshire,â and a second edition of it in 1783.  In 1797, he was chosen
one of the Council, and a few years afterwards Treasurer, of the Society
of Antiquaries, many of his communications to which are printed in the
âArchÃ¦ologia.â  In 1801, on the death of the Revd. Mr. Manning, who had
been engaged for some years in compiling the âHistory of Surrey,â Mr.
Bray undertook to complete the work.  The first volume was published in
1804, the second in 1809, and the third in 1814.  His next and last
literary undertaking was the editing of the âEvelyn Memoirs,â which he
completed in 1817. {6}  Although in his 80th year, he transcribed in his
own handwriting nearly the whole of Mr. Evelynâs Journal.

He died from weakness, and without any disorder, on the 21st of December,
1832, having entered his 97th year on the 15th of the preceding month.

His habits before marriage did not promise either an industrious or a
very long life.  He spent almost every night at cards, and many of his
mornings in other amusements.  After his marriage he became more
attentive to his professional business; but he continued for many years
to live more like a bachelor than a married man, spending most of his
evenings in the society of his numerous friends, or at a coffee-house.
He was very hospitable both in bed and board, but in the plainest way.
His surplus income was laid out in purchases at Shere and in planting,
and he left no personal property except his life insurances.  The family
estate devolved on his death to his grandson Edward, who lived at Shere,
and died in 1866, at the age of 72.

MEMORANDA


1806, _Nov._ 15_th_.âThis day, I completed my 70th year, without having
ever met with any accident of consequence and with very little
interruption to my health, except in January last, when I had a very
serious attack by an inflammation in my lungs, but from which I am
perfectly recovered.  My eyesight is so good that I can and generally do
use my eyes in reading or writing from the time of getting up in the
morning till 10 at night.  My hearing is in no way impaired.  I have not
lost one front tooth and very few others.  I am able to walk or ride 4 or
5 hours together, but I do not ride fast.  My memory is perhaps not so
good as it has been.  On the whole I seem to be in a perfect good state
of health, thanks be to God.

1808, _Nov._ 15_th_.âThis day I completed my 72nd year; and thanks to
Godâs mercies I find myself in as perfect health as I ever enjoyed in my
life, and the only perceivable difference in any of my senses that I am
aware of is a little degree of deafness in my right ear, but as the other
is perfect, I do pretty well.  My left eye I think has not perfectly
recovered the severe inflammation which I had two or three years ago, but
the other being sound, I read and write as well and as much as ever.  My
teeth remain perfect in front and without any additional loss to those
which decayed some years ago.

1810, _April_ 5_th_.âI quitted the Board of Green Cloth, after having had
a place there for 49 years and a half.  I was put on the superannuation
list at my request, the Lord Steward having kindly procured leave for it.
He also, unsolicited, gave me leave to resign my place of Clerk of the
Verge to my son.

_Nov._ 14_th_.âAfter dinner, I found a giddiness in my head making me
unable to walk, and a kind of dumb confusion in my head.  I wrote to Mr.
Heaviside to come, which he did and ordered immediate cupping. {51}  The
next morning my complaint was gone.

1814, _May_ 30_th_.âReceived from Mr. Sydenham Malthus the melancholy
news of my sonâs death at Exmouth, from the rupture of a blood-vessel in
the lungs.

1817, _Feb._ 15_th_.âMy grandson Henry died this morning.

1826, _June_ 16_th_.âIn chaise to Guildford, the County election, voted
for Mr. Sumner and Mr. Denison. {52a}

_Sept._ 19_th_.âWith Mary and Miss Davis, in a chaise, by Horsham and
Henfold to the âAlbionâ at Brighton.  Dined and lay there; walked on the
Chain Pier.

20_th_.âTo Seaford, Eastbourne.  Dined and lay at the âHopeâ in the
Sea-houses.

21_st_.âTo the Castle Hotel, Hastings; through Winchelsea to Rye; New
Romney, dined and lay there.

22_nd_.âTo Hythe, through Folkestone to Dover; saw the harbour; returned
to Hythe, the âSun,â dined there.  To Ashford, and lay there.

_Sept._ 23_rd_.âTo Lenham âStarâ at Maidstone; Wrotham Heath; Sevenoaks;
Godstone to Reigate; Called on Mr. Glover; Dorking; Shere before 7. {52b}

1828, _Dec._ 24_th_.âSuch has been the decay in my eyesight the whole of
this year that I have not been able to read either print or MS., though I
have continued to write letters, as I am writing on this 24th of
December.  I cannot read it when written.  I have also lost my hearing in
one ear in a great degree; subject to this, my bodily health has been
what may be called good.  I have been obliged to pay more than Â£1,100 by
the treachery of a clerk, and the malice of one who had been long
attempting, and at last effected a loss of long friendship with Mrs.
Wigzell. {53a}

1832, _July_ 5_th_.âMr. Linnell, a portrait painter was sent by my
grandson Reginald to paint a portrait of me.  I had five sittings.

_Oct._ 18_th_.âI sent my curious MS. of the Bishopsâ estates seized and
sold by Cromwell to Mr. Ellis, {53b} to be presented to the Trustees of
the British Museum.

FOOTNOTES


{6}  It appears from his account of the Evelyn Family, in the second
volume of the âHistory of Surrey,â that he had read these Memoirs as long
before as 1809.

{7a}  Whom he afterwards married.  She was the daughter of Mr. Stevens,
of Perry Hill, Worplesdon, and lived with her aunt, Mrs. Norwood, at
Guildford.  She was two years older than Mr. Bray, who was then only two
months past 19.

{7b}  Mr. Flutter and his brother were Mayors of Guildford more than
once, and the name of Flutter appears twice in the list of Mayors in the
reign of Charles II.

{7c}  A lad of nineteen.

{7d}  Mr. Duncumb was Rector of Shere.  His father had purchased the
advowson from Mr. Edward Bray, and was a connexion by marriage.

{8a}  Mr. Wilpley was what was then called an Apothecary.

{8b}  Mr. Emily was his cousin, their grandfathers having married the

{9a}  Jacky was Mr. Martyrâs son.  He was called to the Bar, and lived at
Guildford to an advanced age.

{9b}  The medical charge for the inoculation was Â£4 4_s._

{11}  He had very little to do at Mr. Martyrâs.  In the summer he was
often at the Bowling-green, and took long walks with his friends, male
and female.  It was not required that any married lady should join the
walking parties.

in his chambers for instruction in his profession, but his attendance
there was not regular.

{15a}  Mr. Jenkins was in Mr. Adderleyâs office, and afterwards entered
into partnership with Mr. Bray.  Mr. James was also in the same office.

{15b}  He went to his French master for some months, an hour at a time;

{23a}  They received friends to tea every evening this week.  They lived
in a house with a garden, in which Mr. Bray planted fruit trees and
shrubs, but where it was does not appear in the Diary.

{23b}  He went to the Bowling-green to play at whist in the winter, and
at howls in the summer.

{24a}  He had been the first performance of Marplot by Garrick.

{24b}  When he took the horse as far as Dorking it was 2_s._ 6_d._

{25a}  The son of the Member for the County.

{25b}  Mr. Godschall, of Weston House, Albury.  An accomplished

late Lord Palmerston.

{25c}  Of Parkhurst, where Rousseau was his guest for some time.

{25d}   Who built the Leith Hill Tower, and was buried there.

{25e}  It is remarkable that a young attorney of 22 should have been
invited to the social meetings of elderly and middle-aged gentlemen of
the highest position in the neighbourhood.  His grandson, the late Mr.
Edward Bray, inherited his companionable qualities, and was welcome in
every house he visited.

{26a}  The Member for the County.

well as Mr. Bray, to Mr. Martyr.  He afterwards purchased a Clerkship in
the Six Clerksâ Office in Chancery.

{27b}  Mr. Brayâs marriage made little difference in his habits this
year.  He was almost every night with his friends at cards or backgammon;
in the summer evenings at bowls; frequently at the morning services on
week days at the Middle Church.  He had very little to do at this time in
his profession.

{28a}  Mr. Lane, of East Horsley Park.

{28b}  Mr. Evelyn, afterwards Sir John, then M.P. for Helstone, had
offered him an appointment at the Board of Green Cloth, which he at
first, by the wish of his wife, declined to accept; but a few days
afterwards, being better advised, he was glad to find that he could still
have it.  The following note was among the Memoranda which he left of his
early life.ââNothing could be pleasanter than our situation at the Board
of Green Cloth.  The Principals were all members of the House of Commons.
We sat in the same room, at the same green cloth table, with them, by
whom we were treated rather as associates than as clerks.â  Mr. Bray was
at first only an assistant, together with Mr. Selwyn, a barrister,
afterwards in large practice; Mr. Blenman, also of the Bar, and Mr.
Fanshawe, but they rose to be chief clerks.  His usual attendance was
from 11 to 3.  He took a house in Holles Street, and settled there
December 14th, but in the following year he moved to Great Russell
Street.

{29}  This child died in July,

{30a} After a Royal birth caudle was given to the Clerks of the Green

His other sons died in childhood.  Mr. Bray had no collateral relations
of his name after the death of his uncle and brothers within many
generations.  His ancestor, Sir Edward Bray, was the heir male of Edmund,
Lord Bray, and succeeded to the family estates; but the title descended
to Lord Brayâs daughters, and was in abeyance until obtained by the late
Baroness Bray.  Mr. Bray was one of the few descendants then living of
Sir Thomas More, whose granddaughter, the daughter of Margaret Roper,
married Sir Edward Bray.  His two daughters, Mary and Catherine, were not
married.

{32a}  He was now getting into the society of literary men.

{32b}  Afterwards Admiral Brodrick.

{32c}  He had entered into partnership with his friend Mr. Jenkins, whose
chambers were in New Inn.

{32d}  The Guildford Races were then in May.

{32e}  Mr. Sturt was a barrister, and a relation of Mr. Brayâs.  Mr.
Budgen, Mr. Talbot, and Mr. Scawen, were trustees of the charity.

{33a}  A tour with Mr. Jenkins to Oxford, Bath, Gloucester, Salisbury,
Blenheim, Fonthill, Longleat, Chepstow, &c.  They hired a carriage and
horses for the journey; and, in a rhyming letter to his wife, he writes:â

    âWe hired from friend Bryant a very good chaise,
    Intending thus travelling quite at our ease.
    James was mounted behind on a fine prancing steed,
    To take care of the baggage and help us if need.â

Mr. Bray wrote a particular description of Fonthill, Stourton, and other
houses visited.

{33b}  Some of his intimate friends dined with him every week.  The
dinner was over at 5 or 6, and he often went afterwards to a
coffee-house.  He also went frequently to the theatres, and sometimes in
the summer to Vauxhall.  His mornings were spent at the Board of Green
Cloth or in New Inn.

{33c}  The house which Mr. Jacobson built, called âLonesome,â has been
pulled down.

{33d}  Mr. Bray went to many different coffee-houses, but most frequently
to the Percy and Mundyâs.  On Sundays he went for an hour to the Buffalo.

{34a}  He had a house at Shere, which his mother lived in, and made a
home for him during his frequent visits, and at little expense, for
riding round in the neighbourhood he got his dinner at one house and tea
at another.  To general information he could now add the gossip of St.
Jamesâs, and he was welcome wherever he went.

{34b}  He kept what he called a chaise or whisky, and two horses.

{34c}  Mr. Penneck was Keeper of the Reading-room at the British Museum
and Rector of Abinger.

{35a}  Betchworth Castle.

{36a}  Mr. Planta, Principal Librarian at the British Museum.

{36b}  This was the tour that he published an account of.  He rode on
horseback 1,800 miles this year.

{36c}  This was a society which met at St. Paulâs Coffee House.  The
subscription was five guineas a year.

{36d}  This plantation sowed all the fir trees between the Windmill and
Pislake.  Another plantation adjoining to the West Churt, sowed all the
ground west of the road to Cranley.

{36e}  This was for his father.

{39b}  When he was in the country he seldom dined at home unless he had
friends with him.

{39c}  His partnership with Mr. Jenkins was dissolved in 1774, but
without any interruption of their friendship.

{39d}  To near the end of his life he would often stop to dine, and
sometimes to sleep, at the inn at Dorking, or Guildford, instead of going
home to Shere.

{39e}  His only surviving son Edward was at Harrow.

{40a}  These were all eminent antiquaries.

{40b}  He was one of the Trustees of the British Museum.

{40c}  He was subject all his life to inflammatory disorder, and
frequently took physic.

{41a}  He went to Church every Sunday, but he did not think it wrong to
use his carriage and horses, or to travel on that day.  Mr. Polhill, the
Rector of Albury, used to go to church in his carriage.

{41b}  Abinger Hall.  Afterwards Lady Donegalâs.

{41c}  Mr. Rice was lord of the Manor of Tooting.

{41d}  The Eaten Bray estate was inherited by Mr. Brayâs ancestor, Sir
Edward Bray, as heir male of Lord Bray, and sold by him.

{41e}  They became clients, and the family have remained among the best
clients of Mr. Brayâs firm.

{42a}  Sir Joseph Mawbey was member for Surrey;made a fortune by a
distillery.  Mr. Briscoe derived the manor of Epsom from his daughter.

house afterwards Colonel Cliveâs.

{44b}  These eight consecutive days were spent in society.  When in
London he dined every week at the âCrown and Anchorâ with his antiquary
friends, and often received them to dinner.  He played at whist still,
but not so often.

{44c}  Sir Peter Burrell married the Baroness Willoughby of Eresby, and
was made Lord Gwydir.  He and his descendants were among the best clients
of Mr. Brayâs office.

{45}  The thermometer fell one and a half degree below zero.

{47a}  As one of the Clerks at the Board of Green Cloth he had to collect
the land tax from the Officers of State.  He received Â£520 from Lord
Grenville for four quartersâ land tax, at 4_s._ in the pound; from the
Duke of Portland, Â£923.; Mr. Pitt, two quarters, Â£456. 15_s._; Lord
Thurlow, do., Â£1,425. 17_s._ 9Â¾_d._

{47d}  Rector of Clapham.

{48a}  Father of the great builder.

{48b}  Afterwards Dean of Canterbury.

{49}  He was confined to the house for more than a week by a bad cold,
which was followed by inflammation in one of his eyes.  The inflammation
was subdued with difficulty by the great oculist Mr. Phipps, afterwards
Sir Watken Waller.  The eye affected became gradually weaker, and the
sight of it was entirely gone for some years before his death, although
exactly when he did not notice.  At the beginning of the 19th century he
was 64; and his sonâs attention to the business of the office in Great
Russell Street enabled him to live more at Shere, but when in London his
habits were little changed.  He dined with the Antiquariesâ Club almost
every week during the season until he was 90.  He did not so frequently
take his meals at the houses of his friends, but at his own table they
were always welcome, and many came.

{51}  He was frequently bled according to the usual practice in those
days.  He was bled the last time when he was 84.

{52a}  Mr. Bray cared very little for politics, but he was not a Tory,
and would not have voted for Mr. Summer if he had not represented the
county for many years and been much respected.

{52b}  Mr. Bray was within a few weeks of 90.  He took no servant with
him.

{53a}  After this shameful affair, neither Mr. Taylor his clerk, nor Mr.
Wigzell had any communications with Mr. Bray or his partners; but as a
mark of repentance Mrs. Wigzell left Mr. Brayâs grandson a legacy of
Â£100, and Mr. Taylor left Â£100 to the firm of Bray and Warren.

{53b}  Principal Librarian at the British Museum; afterwards Sir Henry
Ellis.  He was Mr. Brayâs oldest friend then living.  He died in 1868 at
a very advanced age, having during his long life rendered most valuable
services to the public, and particularly by his contributions to English
history.

{53c}  Mr. Higgins was employed by Mr. Bray in writing for him.  His last
guest at Shere was his old friend Mr. Carlisle, one of the Secretaries of
the Antiquary Society, who came to Shere on Saturday, the 28th of
October, and remained till Monday.  His grandson Reginald was with him
for a day or two every week, and played at piquette with him three days
before his death, which took place on the 21st.
