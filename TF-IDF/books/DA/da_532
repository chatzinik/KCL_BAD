PREFACE.


The following pages are a reprint of extracts from the file of the
_Norwich Mercury_, which, under the heading of âYarmouth Notes,â have
recently appeared in the columns of the _Yarmouth Mercury_; and in
consequence of a very generally expressed wish on the part of the public,
re-appear in the present form.

At the time these notices of Yarmouth News appeared in the _Norwich
Mercury_, that journal was the organ of the old Whig party, and such of
them, as treat of politics, being doubtless tinged by the party feeling
of the Editor, should be so taken and read.

The idea of collating this matter suggested itself to the compiler upon
the occasion of Geo. Wm. Darby Palmer-Kerrison, Esq., presenting the file
of the _Norwich Mercury_, (then in his Library), but which had been
preserved by the late Robert Palmer Kemp, Esq., to the Yarmouth Free
Library, and it is hoped that this action will not only prove of some
entertainment and amusement to the reader, but also will be of service to
any person who may, in the future, deal with local events as affecting
the history of the borough of Great Yarmouth.

                                                                  F. D. P.

Mayor, in the chair) to take into consideration âthe expediency of

Esq., Samuel Tolver, Esq. (Town-clerk), and Mr. Ferrier took part, and a

gentlemen in their carriages, comprising all the consequence and wealth
of the town.â

Aug. 12th.âA meeting had been held to congratulate the King on his

1831.


Feb. 10thâ_The Gorleston and Southtown Magazine_ had been issued in
weekly numbers or monthly parts, and contained a biographical notice of
Mr. Dawson Turner, F.S.A., &c.

Feb. 17th.âAmongst the vessels lost and driven ashore by the then late
gales were the Alfred (Simmonds), the Flora, the Juno (Moss), the
Elizabeth and Mary Welch (Amis), and the Anson (Garwood).

March 5th.âContains the following notice of Mr. Palmerâs Fancy Dress
Ball:â

                           MR. PALMERâS FANCY BALL.

    In our notice of this amusement at the late Festival, we recollect to
    have saidââThe ice has been broken, the pleasure has been felt, and
    we shall be mistaken if the next effort be not more successful.â
    This prediction, intended at the time to be applied to future
    festivals, we did not expect to be so soon, so completely, or so
    successfully fulfilled, as in the instance we now have the pleasure
    to record.  This entertainment was given at the Town Hall on Tuesday
    evening last, in celebration of the attainment of his majority by Mr.
    S. Palmer, the grandson of the late Danby Palmer, Esq., whose
    extended private connections and still wider mercantile pursuits have
    bequeathed to his grandson a more numerous portion of friends than it
    is the lot of most persons to enjoy at an early period of life.  The
    invitations were sent out with such hospitality, the preparations
    were on so munificent a scale, that the spirit of the donor seemed to
    diffuse itself not only to all those who were about to be present,
    but to all the inhabitants of the borough.  The novelty, the
    continued arrivals, the firing of cannon, the banners floating at the
    Town Hall, and in various parts of the town, the gay appearance of
    the ships in the harbour, most of which were decorated with pennons,
    as were several vessels in the Roadsâall aided in keeping alive the
    expectation, so that in the evening the Quay, around the hall, was
    crowded with persons anxious to see the companyâso anxious, indeed,
    that the carriage windows were assailed by men and women jumping up
    to get a peep at the interior.  The company began to assemble about
    half-past eight, and on entering the ball room were announced by
    name, and received by Mr. Palmer and his mother and Miss A. Burton
    (to whom, we understand, Mr. Palmer is about to be united.)  These
    ladies appeared in very elegant Court dresses, and Mr. Palmer in a
    full-dress Court suit.  Till ten oâclock the company continued to
    arrive, at which hour Mr. Palmer opened the Ball by leading off a
    country dance with Miss A. Burton.  We never saw a similar
    entertainment combining so great a variety of character.  The
    brilliancy of the colours and the constant succession of costumes,
    the reliefs, the contrasts, and the varying shades, reminded us
    forcibly of those beautiful combinations formed by the kaleidoscope,
    of which, visually, this scene may be said to have been an animated
    representation.  On the one side of a quadrille was to be seen the
    gawdy Spaniard, leading with haughty dignity the lively Mrs. Ford of
    the Elizabethian age; while behind him stood pondering oâer the
    fleeting vanity of this world the solitary Friar; opposite ranged the
    joyous Sailor, indulging his mirth at the expense of the courtly
    dignity of his fair partner.  At one end was the Old Gentleman of two
    centuries since, in all the gravity and politeness of that age,
    leading forth some sprightly Tyrolese; while at the other was a
    Chinese Mandarin, paired off with a black-eyed Gipsy; a little
    further, and the Scotchman promenaded with the brilliant Circassian;
    the Frieselander with the simply-dressed Quakeress; the Queen of
    Scots with the bronze and fierce Turk; the reckless Massaroni with
    the lively Mrs. Page; the dark Colombian with the prim lady of an
    hundred years ago; the Forester with the Flower Girl; the haughty
    Knight Templar with the simple Swiss Peasant; the chivalrous Pole
    with the heavy Russian; the youthful Ivanhoe with a French Peasant;
    and to crown the diversity, Day and Night were to be seen at once,
    arm and arm with a Chimney Sweep.

April 14th.âThe Preston (Capt. Woodthorpe), with passengers, for Prince
Edwardâs Island and Quebec, had been towed down the Harbour.

May 5th.âThis number contains the following account of the Borough
Election, consequent upon the rejection of a Reform Bill:â

    The Mayor, in opening the proceedings, said that the electors were
    met to exercise an important trust, that of electing two persons to
    represent the Boroughâa trust at all times of the greatest
    responsibility, but certainly never more so than at the present
    eventful crisis.  Determined as he was to act with strict justice,
    and with that fairness and impartiality which were the best ornaments
    of the office he had the honour to hold, he entreated that the
    contest in which they were now about to be engaged might be conducted
    on both sides with that order and decorum that forbearance and
    moderation due from gentlemen to gentlemen, and from man to man.
    (Cheers.)

    Mr. B. Dowson, in a brief but emphatic address, put in nomination the
    Hon. George Anson, this was seconded by R. Palmer Kemp, Esq.

    T. Clowes, Esq., then proposed, in an address replete with sterling
    sense and strength, C. E. Rumbold, Esq., seconded by J. Shelley,
    Esq., who adverted to the circumstance of Mr. Colville being a
    merchant connected with the West Indian Trade and a supporter of
    colonial slavery.

    I. Preston, Esq., jun., and â White, Esq., nominated A. Colville,
    Esq., and J. Lacon, Esq., jun., and Mr. J. Laws nominated W. Bliss,
    Esq.

    Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold addressed the electors at considerable
    length, pointing out the merits of the measure they supported, during
    which they were enthusiastically cheered.

    Mr. Colville also spoke at length, amid much tumult, during which he
    was interrupted by loud yells of various kindsâattacking the Bill for
    its disfranchising nature, and defending colonial slavery.

    Mr. Bliss had not arrived at that time.

    A poll was determined and immediately opened and continued till five
    oâclock on that and the following day, when the numbers were
    announced by the Committee of Anson and Rumbold to beâ

For Col. Anson       748
Mr. Rumbold          748
Mr. Colville         503
Mr. Bliss            497

    The poll was adjourned till Monday.

    On Sunday morning, however, Messrs. Colville and Bliss left the town,
    or, as our correspondent writes, âMay Day became more than commonly
    exhilarating, by the agreeable information quickly diffused through
    the town, that the enemies of freedom and of the Constitution had
    fled, happy in evading and escaping from merited punishment, so
    irritated were the minds of the lower class of society against these
    obtruders, without a shadow of claim to their suffrages, that, by
    their flight on Sunday morning, they probably escaped an ablution in
    the waters of the beautiful river Yare.â

    On Monday the books opened, and at the close the final numbers wereâ

For Col. Anson       903
Mr. Rumbold          903
Mr. Colville         547
Mr. Bliss            541

    This vexatious contest, for it was vexatious, inasmuch as it was
    opposed to the general wish of the inhabitants, as not the slightest
    chance of success prevailed from the commencement, and the only
    object of which was to extract money from the purses of the two
    Members, terminated, not only in the triumphant defeat of the
    Boroughmongers, but by affording a lesson to the Charles Street
    Society in London, whose only object is to continue corruption, by
    the means of corruption, a proof that true independence and love of
    country is far beyond the purchase of the greatest wealth.  But the
    friends of Reform at Yarmouth have set a noble example of
    consistency, for they have commenced among themselves one of the
    modes which the Reform Bill will enforce.  They have determined to
    raise among themselves a sum sufficient to defray the legal expenses
    of the election, and to return their well-tried Members as unhurt in
    their finances as they are independent in principal, and by this mark
    of gratitude and esteem to repay the obligations which the
    inhabitants of Yarmouth in common with the country at large owe to
    the supporters of the Reform BillâÂ£1,750âhas already been raised.  We
    say to the rest of the nation, âGo thou and do likewise.â

    The Chairing of the Members had taken place amid the most
    enthusiastic cheers.

May 19th.âThe thanks of the Yarmouth District Committee for saving lives
from shipwreck was voted to Lieut. Harmer, R.N., on saving the crew of
the schooner Fleece, which had been wrecked on the Scroby Sand on the
14th inst.

May 26th.âThe men employed by Messrs. Grout, Baylis, and Co., had an
excellent dinner provided for them at J. B. Balesâ, Apollo Gardens.

June 9th.âThe Mayor had obtained a rule for a mandamus commanding the
Members of the Corporation to attend a Court for the âtransaction of
public business.â

June 16th.âThe population had increased 3,024 since the census of 1821,
the numbers beingâ

1831.       22,028 including 913 sailors.
1821.       19,004.
            3,024 increase.

The remaining part of the Eastern Regiment of Norfolk Militia, consisting
of about 440 men, had assembled for 28 daysâ training, under the command
of Major Sir E. K. Lacon.

June 23rd.ââOur venerable and highly respected Recorder, Robert Alderson,
Esq., had delivered in his resignation.â

June 30th.âThe Bishop of Norwich consecrated St. Maryâs Church,
Southtown.  His Lordship was met by the Corporation âin full robes,â the
Hon. and Rev. Viscount Nevill, the Rev. R. Turner, J. Kitson, Esq.
(Registrar), W. Rackham, Esq. (Proctor), and the principal clergymen and
gentry of the neighbourhood.

The following was the âcorrect statementâ of the population, taken by the
Overseers on 30th May and following days, and sworn by them in Petty
Session:â

Males                          8,980
Females                       12,135
                              21,115
Sailors                          913
                              22,028
Inhabited houses               4,570
Number of families             4,869
Houses building                   23
Houses uninhabited               191

July 7th contains the following notice of the laying the first stone of
St. Peterâs Church:â

âFor some days past notices had been issued that the first stone of the
new Church, to be erected in this town, was to be laid this day; and at
half-past ten this morning the Mayor, Corporation, gentry, and
inhabitants assembled at the Town Hall, and proceeded to St. Nicholasâ
Church.  Prayers were read by the Rev. Harvey Bawtree, and after service
the procession moved in the following order:âBellman, Church Beadles,
Constables, the Corporation Band, Hospital Charity Children, Inhabitants
and Gentry, Officers of the Navy, Mr. J. J. Scoles, the Architect, the
Clergy of Yarmouth and its vicinity, the Regalia, the Right Worshipful
Edmund Preston, Esq., the Mayor, his Majestyâs Lieutenant for the County,
the Hon. and Very Rev. Dr. Pellew, Dean of Norwich, and the Rev. Richard
Turner, the Right Hon. and Rev. Viscount Nevill, the Deputy-Mayor, the
Aldermen in their scarlet gowns, the Common Councilmen, Constables.  On
arriving at the ground, the procession passed once round the building to
the north-east corner.

A copy of the inscription, which had been written on vellum, and placed
with the coins of the present King in a bottle, hermetically sealed, was
then read by the Town Clerk:â

    âGreat Yarmouth.âThe first stone of this Church, dedicated to St.
    Peter, and erected by His Majestyâs Commissioners for building new
    Churches (under the authority of an Act of Parliament, 58th Geo. III.
    c. 45) on a site granted by the Corporation, and with the assistance
    of their donations, and the subscriptions of several of the
    inhabitants of the town and its vicinity, was laid on the seventh day
    of July, in the second year of the reign of His Most Gracious Majesty
    King William the Fourth, MDCCCXXXI., by the Right Worshipful Edmund
    Preston, Esquire, Mayor; the Right Reverend Henry Bathurst, Lord
    Bishop of the Diocese; the Honourable and Very Reverend George
    Pellew, D.D., Dean of Norwich; the Honourable and Reverend Edward
    Pellew, M.A., Minister of the parish.  Architect, Joseph John Scoles;
    contractors, John Pigg, Jeremiah Wright, George Cattermole, Samuel
    Bligh, James Watson.â

The children sang the 100th Psalm during the operation of inserting the
bottle in a cavity, and securing the stone, which had been prepared to
receive it.  A silver trowel was then presented by the Architect, and
after the Mayor had spread the mortar, the stone was lowered to the
proper place, and the ceremony of striking it was performed by the Clergy
and Corporation in succession.

The Dean offered up appropriate prayers, accompanied by an address
expressly composed for this occasion.  The children then sang a collect.
The Mayor afterwards addressed the company present, on the pious work
which they had assisted in commencing; amidst the general plaudits of the
surrounding multitude the band struck up âGod save the King,â and the
company returned to the Town Hall and partook of an elegant cold
collation.

âThe Church, which has been so happily begun, is calculated to contain
1,800 persons, and three-fifths of the seats are to be appropriated for
ever as free sittings.â

August 25th.âContains the following notice:ââBy invitation from the Mayor
and Mrs. Preston, on Monday sennight, to a promenade at their beautiful
garden, situate on the banks of the river Yare, were assembled almost all
the fashion of the town and its vicinity.  At seven oâclock the band
struck up the national air of âGod Save the King,â immediately after
which the younger part of the company formed themselves into quadrilles,
&c., upon the grass plat, near the centre of which tables were supplied
with wines of the first quality and every refreshment in season.  At
eight oâclock a fire balloon ascended from the grounds in very fine
style, which was visible on the grounds and town for about twenty
minutes.  The amusements concluded with a brilliant display of fireworks.
The extreme serenity of the evening, aided by the wild light of the moon
and the more refulgent illumination of the garden with variegated lamps,
rendered this a scene which for good humour and pleasantness has rarely
or ever been equalled in this town.â

Sept. 1st.âMr. Shelly attended the Corporation meeting and insisted on
reading a protest in respect of the non-attendance of that body to their
âordinance.â  The following officers were then elected:â

Mayor-ElectâJohn Preston, Esq.

ChamberlainâMr. E. Youell.

After the above account of sport, it is needless to say that everyone who
attended the Races was delighted.  The severe running on the first day
prevented several of the horses starting on the second, but the four
well-contested heats for the Town and Country Gentlemenâs Plate more than
compensated for the deficiency in the number of horses.  The ordinaries
and Ball were well attendedâa very liberal subscription was entered into
for the Races of 1832.  The Gold Cup Stakes is already filled, and the
Norfolk and Suffolk Huntersâ Stake of 5 sovs. each, with 20 sovs. added,
for horses not thoroughbred, which have been regularly hunted in either
of the above counties, has already six subscribers.  The ladies at the
Ball on Tuesday evening commenced a subscription for a Ladiesâ Plate of
50 sovs. for next year, which will be in addition to the two Fifty Pounds
Plates usually given.  Edmund Preston, Esq., is appointed one of the
stewards for 1832.â

Sept. 29th.âThe Reformers of Yarmouth âhad an excellent meetingâ at the
Town-hall.  Mr. Alderman Barth was in the chair, and Messrs. Clowes, S.
Cobb, Shelley, Hammond, Sewell, and Munsey took part in the proceedings.

Oct. 6th.âThe Mayor (John Preston, Esq.,) âcelebrated his inauguration at
the Town-hall on Thursday sennight by a sumptuous entertainment, which
was attended by the Lord Lieutenant, Judge Alderson, Sir W. Folkes, M.P.,
the Hon. E. Pellew, and about 300 gentlemen of the county and town.â

Nov. 17th.âA Board of Health had been established for the better
cleansing the streets and lanes, and the removal of nuisances.

The âStarâ coach, when about a mile this side of Eye, was driven into by
âa fellow in a drunken state,â and one of the leaders was killed on the
spot.

Nov. 24th.âThe dairy of John Waters, Esq., of Ormesby, had been broken
into and 16 pints of butter, 14 cheeses, a fat goose, and a quantity of
meat and flour stolen.

Large flocks of âStormy Petrelsâ had visited our shores, and between 6
and 7 dozen of them taken alive; several âLittle Auksâ and âArctic Gullsâ
had also been shot.

Dec. 29th.âA poor man known as âDo you know himâ was insulted, by a man
pulling a nightcap over his face, and at the same time informing him that
he was about to be âburked,â which so much âalarmed the poor creature,
that he was taken to his home in a desponding state.â



1832.


Jan. 5th.âThe Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew had distributed the prizes to the
Sunday School children.

Jan. 12th.âDr. Cox had delivered a very interesting lecture on
âPhysiology.â

Feb. 2nd.âThe Rev. Henry Squire was advertised to deliver a course of
lectures at the Old Meeting.

The case of the King against the Aldermen of Yarmouth is reported.

Feb. 9th.âWith regard to which the following notice appears this week:â

                  THE KING AGAINST THE ALDERMEN OF YARMOUTH.

    We are authorized to state that the Report of the hearing of this
    cause, in our last weekâs paper, is incorrect, Lord Tenterden having
    observed that there was no ground for an attachment, as the parties
    had acted _bona fide_; that the business of the Corporation must be
    done, and directed that the rule should be enlarged, to give the
    Defendants an opportunity of doing so.  The Counsel for the
    Defendants said they were ready to proceed, but could not compel the
    Mayor to call an Assembly, or the Common Councilmen to
    meet,âwhereupon his Lordship, on the motion of Defendantsâ Counsel,
    directed a mandamus to be issued for the filling up all vacancies,
    and then transacting the other necessary business; and upon a Return
    being made to the Writ, the Rule will be discharged.

Feb. 16thâA general meeting of the inhabitants was proposed to be held to
take into consideration the expediency of erecting a new Workhouse, âit
appearing by a report of the select Vestry now published, that the
present one is quite inadequate to the purpose, both as to extent and
arrangement, and as being utterly incapable of affording room for that
classification which is indispensable to the moral improvement and
employment of its inmates, and also to the comfort of the aged and
infirm.  It is now about fifty years since any room was added to it.  The
increase of inhabitants in the town, and not less so of pauperism during
that period, calls for enlarged accommodation.  It appears by the report
that they are without a day room for the females, or any means of
separating the sick from the healthy, and so cramped for lodging room,
that a considerable number of the inmates are compelled to sleep three in
a bed.  It is intended to proceed agreeably to the directions of the 59th
Geo. III. cap 12, and 1st and 2nd of William IV. cap. 42.â

March 22nd.âThe National Fast had been observed âwith a decent
solemnity.â

April 5th.âThe appointment of a Recorder is noticed as follows:ââAt a
Corporate Assembly, held on Tuesday last, the long-contested question of
âwho should fill the office of Recorder for the borough?â (vacant by the
resignation of Robert Alderson, Esq.,) was decided.  The first business
which came before the Court was the accepting of that gentlemanâs
resignation, after which Isaac Preston, Sen., Esq., proposed the
Sub-Steward (I. Preston, Esq.,) to fill the vacant office; this was
seconded by C. Symonds, Esq.  R. Cory, Esq., then proposed Mr. Sergeant
Merewether; this nomination was seconded by Samuel Paget, Esq.  On a
ballot being demanded, the numbers were found to be equal, viz., 20 for
Merewether and the same number for Preston.  There were 41 members of the
body present, one of whom declined voting.  A second ballot was proposed
and acceded to, and the same result followed.  The Deputy-Mayor (who
presided in consequence of the extreme ill health of the Mayor) then said
that he would give the members of the Court the chance of a third ballot,
on which the gentleman before mentioned voted for Merewether, which gave
the learned Sergeant a majority of one, the numbers being for Merewether
21, for Preston 20.  Thus has terminated this long agitated question, the
product of much squabbling, aye, and of much litigation too.  Lord
Viscount Exmouth was unanimously chosen Lord High Steward; Isaac Preston,
Jun., Esq., and J. Baker, Esq., were elected Aldermen; and Messrs. J. E.
Lacon, E. H. L. Preston, Henry Costerton and Samuel Jay, Common
Councilmen.  At this Court, Mr. J. Seaman received the appointment of
Parish Clerk, and Mr. J. Daniel, Sexton; 50 guineas were also voted to
St. Maryâs Church, Southtown; Â£15 per year granted to Mrs. Breeze (widow
of the late hall-keeper), and Â£12 annuity settled on Mrs. Absolon (widow
of the late Parish Clerk.)  It was likewise ordered that the usual fee of
20s. upon apprenticesâ indentures should be taken off.  It is only right
to state that the entire business of the day was conducted in the most
amicable way possible, and that the greatest good temper and gentlemanly
feeling was displayed during the discussion on the pending Recordership.â

April 12th.âThe thanks of the Corporation were voted to the Rev. R.
Turner upon his resignation of his office of Chaplain to that body.

The Sylvan (owned by J. H. Palmer, Esq., and commanded by Captain W.
Gilham) and the Preston (belonging to I. Preston, Esq.) had respectively
sailed with 100 and 110 emigrants.

April 19th.âTwo more emigrant vessels, the Syren and Miser, were
advertised to sail for America.âOn Friday, then last, (here commonly
called Black Friday) the annual meeting had been held at the Guild Hall
for the purpose of âreading overâ the income and expenditure of our local
affairs when âsecundum custom (sic.) it was proved that the receipts of
any sum, say Â£5,299, and the payment of Â£5,298 was balanced by Â£1 being
added to the credit side.â  Mr. Shelly and other gentlemen protested
against the manner in which these accounts were made out and presented to
the freemen.

April 26th.âThe newly elected Common Councilmen, Messrs. John Lacon, E.
H. L. Preston, Henry Costerton, and Samuel Jay entertained the
Corporation and others.  John Lacon, Esq., presided, and the following
toasts were given:âThe King, Queen Adelaide, Princess Victoria, and the
Royal Family, Lord Hill and the Army, Sir James Graham and the Navy, Lord
Viscount Exmouth, the County Members, &c.

Burglaries had been committed on the premises of Mr. William Green,
Messrs. Bracey and Son, Mr. Benjamin Welch, and Mr. Joseph Stevenson, and
a man named Woolsey had been charged with the offences.

May 3rd.âThe Fair had been held without âA Yarmouth Fair Wind,â and was
âvery numerously and respectably attended, nor could its visitants
complain of lack of amusements, for of remarkable giantesses, as
remarkable dwarfs, optical dioramas, &c., &c., there were quantum suff,
while roundabouts, Russian swings, and ups-and-downs displayed themselves
in abundance to allure the juvenile part of the company out of their
stray half-pence and pence.â

May 10th.âThe southern bastion of the fort had fallen âwith an immense
crash.â

The âfirst fruits of the fishing seasonâ had been landed by a boat, (No.
3), belonging to Mr. George Giles.  The nightâs haul had produced 48
mackerel, which sold at 1s. 6d. each.

The following vessels had been launched:âThe brig Sarah, 190 tons (from
Messrs. Tuckâs yard), and the brig Sarepta, 160 tons (from Mr. Lubbockâs
yard.)

May 17th.âThe news that the Duke of Wellington had âgiven in and that
Lord Grey was then at the palaceâ was received with joy, and the bells
had been rung.

May 24th.âThe Rattlesnake (180 tons) had been launched from Mr. F.
Prestonâs yard.

The mackerel fishery was going on badly, and there was great distress in
the town, as thousands depended on that industry for a living.

May 31st.âThere had been a great fire at Messrs. Grout and Coâs. Factory,
the loss estimated at Â£12,000, the premises were uninsured.

Two female factory hands, aged respectively 16 and 17, had âfought it
outâ on the Denes, the prize, a âyoung tar,â when the âshorter combatantâ
proved victorious.

June 7th.âThe Kingâs birthday had been celebrated with a great display of
flags, the firing of the Church bells, salutes from the Forts, batteries,
etc.

June 14th.âThe following notice appears as to the Reform Act:â

                                   REFORM.

    For some days previous to the passing of the new Magna Charta of our
    liberties, the Reform Bill, the friends of that great and really
    Conservative measure had met at the Ship Tavern, for the purpose of
    considering the best method of celebrating the anticipated triumph.
    At their first meeting it was determined to open a subscription,
    leaving the precise manner in which the proceeds should be expended
    as a matter for future consideration.  District Committees were
    forthwith appointed to manage the collections.  The subscription,
    which is not yet closed, is expected to amount to something very
    handsome.  It was first intended to give the freemen a dinner, but on
    sounding the latter it was found that they (without any exception)
    preferred receiving a pecuniary present; it was therefore at a
    subsequent meeting resolved, that each of those persons should
    receive a donation in money, and that the friends of Reform should
    dine together at a time and place hereafter to be appointed.  The
    news of the passing of the unmutilated Bill was received here with
    every demonstration of joy.  The vessels at the Quay displayed a
    profusion of flags, as did also the principal taverns and inns in the
    townâindeed everything seemed to show a universal gladness of heart.
    On Friday last, however, when information arrived of the Royal
    sanction having been given to the Bill, the fullness of joy exhibited
    on the occasion knew no bounds.  Expectant of the event, a large
    party of our townsmen (of every grade and condition in life) had
    proceeded along the Southtown Road on the forenoon of the day,
    accompanied by a band, flags with appropriate mottoes, &c., to meet
    the Telegraph.  Singular enough, however, the guard of that coach
    refused to take up the colours, and in answer to repeated enquiries
    declared âthere was no news,â although it was afterwards ascertained
    that he had read from a newspaper in his possession an account of the
    Royal signature to the inhabitants of Gorleston while passing through
    that village.  The Reformers of Yarmouth, to show their indignant
    sense of such conduct, refused to wait at night for the Morning Star
    (that coach being under the same proprietory as the Telegraph), but
    instantly sent a courier to Lowestoft to announce their intention of
    meeting, in procession, the Old Blue.  Ultimately, that coach,
    surrounded by a profusion of elegant and appropriate flags, bands
    playing, &c., paraded the town.  It was really a most animating and
    exhilarating spectacle; numbers of elegant and beautiful females
    assembled at the windows to witness the heart-cheering sight of a
    countless multitude of persons, composed of all ranks in life, alike
    animated by one feeling, that of exultation and delight.  Surely
    after this our enemies will no longer prate of a reaction!  At any
    rate, such a flagrant attempt at delusion would be scouted by our
    patriotic townsmen, as one of the basest of libels on old Yarmouth *
    * * * The public dinner, rejoicings, &c., will, we have just heard,
    not take place till after the passing of the Scotch and Irish Bills.
    The dinner, will, we believe, be held at the Town Hall, there being
    no reason to doubt that the Mayor, with his accustomed gentlemanly
    feeling, will grant the building for that purpose.  Wm. Barth, Esq.,
    is expected to preside.

During the Spring eight vessels had sailed from Yarmouth to different
parts of the Canadas, carrying 916 passengers.

June 21st.âThe Haven and Pier Commissioners had attended for the purpose
of examining the Harbour Works, and it was hoped that extensive
improvements would be made therein.

The Conservatives had not announced any candidates, and it was considered
probable that Messrs. Anson and Rumbold would be re-elected.

The Rev. Mr. Griffith, junr., had delivered a very impressive sermon on
board the Cyrus under the Bethel Flag.

June 28th.âThe Corporation had voted an address to the King upon his
escape from the late âatrociousâ attack upon him.

A vessel was lying off the Pier Head with the Yellow Flag (cholera)
flying.

July 5th.âA public dinner was to be held to celebrate the passing of the
Reform Bill, and Mr. Windham, the Liberal candidate for E. Norfolk, was
to meet his friends, Major Keppel being unable to accompany him.

July 12th.âThe Dreadnought lugger (having on board a large cargo of
smuggled goods) had been captured.

The Sylvan (belonging to J. H. Palmer, Esq.,) had arrived at Quebec with
emigrants.

July 26th.âThe annual water frolic is thus noticed: âMonday last was our
annual water frolic.  The heavens, which appeared inauspiciously to lour
during the early part of the day, cleared about noon, and a cloudless and
sun-lit sky enabled the admirers of boating excursions to enjoy with high
zest the pleasures afforded them by the recurrence of this aquatic treat.
The beautiful bosom of Breydon was literally covered with craft of every
description, from the stately barge and elegant pleasure boat, down to
the humble punt.  Three boats, the Coriander, Balls; the Emerald, of
Lowestoft, Col. Jones; and the Hornet, of Beccles (the two latter
latteeners), were the competitors for the cup.  The former had the start,
and kept the lead during the three heats, and eventually won by 400
yards.  About five oâclock p.m. the boats drew up for dinner.  The _toute
ensemble_ was at this time picturesque in the extreme, the river, as we
have said, studded with boats of various descriptions; the rond (which at
this time was more than usually dry and firm) crowded with well-dressed
persons of both sexes, whose joyous countenances showed that they looked
gratifyingly on the sight; the beautiful ruins of Burgh Castle (the
Garianonum of the ancients) in the distance, gilded with the gloomy
brightness of a western sunâthe declivity of the hill bedecked with many
tea-drinking parties, all presented a scene which must have given delight
to every true lover of his species.  On the following day a cup (the gift
of the spirited landlord of the Berney Arms) was sailed for by five 14
feet boats, which was won by the Sultan, George Alexander, who beat her
antagonists hollow.  We are happy to say that the general feeling of
pleasure was not alloyed by the occurrence of a single accident.â

The Theatre had opened with _Guy Mannering_ and _Damp Beds_.  There was a
very poor house.

The brig Ida (188 tons) had been launched from Mr. F. Prestonâs yard.

August 23rd.âThe following estimate of the number of electors under the
Reform Act had been made:âFreemen 1,063; Â£10 householders in Yarmouth,
492; and in Gorleston, 144; total, 1,699.

The Summer Fishing had commenced; 300 lasts of herring had already been
brought in.

August 30th.âMessrs. Windham and Keppel (the Liberal candidates for East
Norfolk) had dined with about 50 electors at the Kingâs Head (B. Dowson,
Esq., in the chair.)

The following Corporate officers had been elected:â

Mayor-ElectâJohn Baker, Esq.

ChamberlainâMr. R. Ferrier.

ChurchwardensâJohn Preston and Charles Symonds, Esqs.

AuditorsâI. Preston, John Danby-Palmer, T. F. Garwood, and Charles J.
Palmer, Esqs.

CollectorsâJohn Danby-Palmer, Esq., and Mr. Henry Costerton.

Sept. 6th.âThe Races had been held and proved very successful.

Sept 13th.âMr. C. E. Rumbold (Col. Anson being detained in Derbyshire by
illness) made a public entry into this town, when the carriage containing
the Hon. Member and N. B. Palmer, Esq., had supported on its roof a most
elegant silk flag bearing the words âGorleston and Southtown Votersâ upon
it.

Sept. 20th.âA public dinner had been given by the Gorleston voters to
Messrs. Anson and Rumbold, when 52 gentlemen attended, and W. Barth,
Esq., occupied the chair.

Oct. 4th.âThe inaugural dinner to the Mayor was held at the Town Hall,
and was attended by ânearly 500 guests, among whom were a large number of
the nobility and gentry residing in or near Yarmouth.â

Oct. 11th.âThe herring fishing had been very unsuccessful.  This was
attributed to warm weather.

Oct. 18th.âThe following notice as to the Wandering Piper appears:ââThe
Wandering Piper, who has attracted so much notoriety, is expected to
visit Yarmouth in the course of a very few days.  He is of a rank in life
which few suspect who are not acquainted with his private history.  He
was for a considerable time an officer in the Army, served under Sir John
Moore and the Duke of Wellington, and sold his commission after the
battle of Waterloo.  His opponent is Count Bender, a French Nobleman, but
educated in Scotland at the same school with the piper, and betwixt him a
great friendship subsisted.  They met in London in 1825, when a dispute
arose between them concerning the hospitality of different nations, which
ended in both parties finally agreeing, for the sum of Â£5,000, to travel
in disguise, the one as a fiddler in France and Belgium, and the other
(our hero) as a piper in Britain and Ireland, to subsist upon what the
public might be pleased to give them unsolicited, and whoever should have
most money in the end was to gain the prize.  They both commenced their
wanderings in the summer of 1825, but an uncle of the piperâs, who then
held a high official situation, having got notice of the freak, put a
stop to the proceedings before the end of three months; this gentleman,
however, died in 1827, which left both parties free from restraint, in
consequence of which they started in August, 1828, the one from
Stonehaven, in Scotland, and the other from Calais, in France.  This
important campaign was only intended to last three years, and would have
been finished before now had not the piper received a severe hurt from
the upsetting of a stage coach in Ireland, which confined him for fifteen
monthsâduring which time there was a secession of hostilities on both
sides.  The piper during his illness lay at the house of Sir Thomas
Butler, Bart., Ballintemple, county Carlow, where he met with the
greatest kindness; indeed, the Irish, high and low, seem to have
completely entered into the spirit of the undertaking.  He was never
allowed in any one instance to pay anything at the hotels where he put
up, waiter, chambermaid, boots, and porter all refused to accept of any
remuneration for their services, nay, the very beggar wished his âhonour
good luck and a safe journey,â without laying him under further
contribution.  He says that he has been charged in all instances to the
very utmost extent in England; we could have wished it had been
otherwise, for the honour of our national character.  During his rambles,
it is said he had given Â£550 to different charities, that receipts for
which are lodged for safety with John Stuart, Esq., of 19, Cleveland Row,
Finsbury Square, London.â

Oct. 25th.âThe wandering piper had begun his rounds and had lunched with
the Mayor.

Nov. 8thâElectioneering partizanship was displaying itself.  A âTrue Red
Committee (composed of the lowest order of beer-loving Burgesses) had
been formedâ and Andrew Colville, Esq., had been requested to stand for
the Borough in that interest.

Nov. 15th.âMr. Colville had arrived in the Borough and addressed the
electors from the âStarâ balcony.

Dec. 6th.âContains the following article:â

    Tuesday last was a proud day for the friends of Reform, comprising as
    they do a vast majority of all ranks of our townâs-people.  It having
    been announced by hand-bill the day previous that Col. Anson and Mr.
    Rumbold would arrive the following day, as early as the hour at noon,
    the Southtown Road was crowded with pedestrians and equestrians of
    all classes.  Between twelve and one oâclock the entire body of the
    Political Union (full 400 strong) assembled at the Guardian Angel,
    with blue ribbons and their badges round their necks.  The worthy
    candidates having arrived at the above inn, the procession began to
    move in the following order:âTwo trumpeters on horseback;
    bannerâYarmouth Union of the Working Classes; flagsâUnion Jack, Royal
    Standard of England; âUniversal Suffrage and Vote by Ballotâ; âShort
    Parliaments and Liberty of the Pressâ; âThe love of our Country leads
    usâ; âClose Corporations abolishedâ; âEqual Laws and Equal Rightsâ;
    âUnited we stand, divided we fallâ; banners of the King and Reform.
    FlagsââGorleston and Southtown Votersâ; âAnson and Rumboldâ;
    âFriends.â  FlagsââThe Peopleâs Causeâ; âThe Poor Manâs Rightsâ;
    âReduction of Taxationâ; âClose Corporations Openedâ; âAbolition of
    Slaveryâ; âCheap Government and Equal Rightsâ; âThe Liberty of the
    Pressâ; âKnowledge is Powerâ; âCivil and Religious Libertyâ; âFreedom
    of Election.â  The procession, on entering the town by the Bridge,
    was welcomed by the exultant shouts of an innumerable concourse of
    expectant individuals, who had by this time lined the new Hall Quay,
    eager to witness the imposing spectacle.  The blue pennons of
    numerous ships, âfloating in the breeze,â added not a little to the
    joyousness of the occasion.  The procession moved on, adding to its
    numbers as it advanced along the Quay, up South Street, along King
    Street, down our beautiful Market Place, and back to the Committee
    Rooms, from the windows of which the assembled multitude (consisting
    certainly of not less than 5,000 persons) were addressed by Mr.
    Alderman Barth, Col. Anson, Mr. Rumbold, and J. Shelly, Esq.  The
    weather was till towards noon rather showery; fortunately it then
    cleared up.  Such, however, appeared to us the general enthusiasm,
    that it seemed as if no weather could have damped the universal
    feeling of delight, nor have abated the desire to witness the
    proceedings of this memorable day.  Numbers of well-dressed females
    from the windows of the houses, as the procession passed along, were
    to be seen, with approving smiles, shaking blue flags, elegant
    banners, &c., &c., thus demonstrating their hearty participation in
    the high feeling of satisfaction which displayed itself all around.
    Too much praise cannot be given to Capt. Garson and Mr. Gamble for
    the judgment shown by them in marshalling the procession.  Nor ought
    we to omit mentioning, in terms of high commendation, the excellent
    conduct of the Union on the occasionâconduct which was noticed in the
    evening at the Kingâs Head, by the Chairman (Mr. T. Hammond) making a
    very handsome acknowledgment of their services, and giving as a toast
    (which was drank with three times three and very general applause)
    âThe Council of the Political Union.â  Surely, if it had been before
    possible for the Conservatives (as they improperly styled themselves)
    to have mistaken the feeling of the town, the proceedings of Tuesday
    last must have entirely undeceived them, and enabled them to see the
    utter hopelessness of a contest with our late excellent
    representatives.  Monday next is the day of election, when we shall
    see whether these hardy and obstinate men are still determined to
    pull down certain ruin on their party.

    On Thursday night Messrs. Anson and Rumbold, addressing their
    numerous friends from the balcony of the Crown and Anchor, were
    insulted by water thrown upon, and it is reported tiles at them, from
    a small _red_ inn adjoining.  This roused the indignation of the
    multitude, and the destruction of the windows was the consequence.  A
    spirited youth resented still further indignity offered to his
    friends by springing from the balcony and seizing upon and destroying
    the enemyâs blood-red standard.

Dec. 15th.âThe nomination took place at the âTol-hall,â and after the
Mayor had opened the proceedings, Col. Anson was nominated by William
Barth, Esq., seconded by Mr. Thomas Clowes, Mr. Rumbold by John Shelly
and John Brightwen, Esqs., and A. Colville, Esq., by John Lacon, Esq.,
and Mr. B. Gooch.  The show of hands was in favour of Messrs. Anson and
Rumbold.  The poll for the first day wasâ

Rumbold        715
Anson          699
Colville       631

And at the close on the second dayâ

Rumbold        838
Anson          829
Colville       751

Dec. 20th.âA dinner had been held to celebrate the return of these
gentlemen, âwhen William Barth, Esq., presided, C. Sayers, Esq., was his
vice, and N. Palmer and John Shelly, Esqs., headed the tables to the
right and left of him.â

July 11th.âThe following is the account of the Burgh Water Frolic:â

    âMonday last being the day appointed for our annual water frolic, an
    immense quantity of boats (from the splendid pleasure barge to the
    humble punt) started from our Bridge at eleven oâclock a.m. with a
    favourable and somewhat stiff breeze from the N.E.  At two oâclock
    the various crafts laid-to in the Narrows to witness the sailing
    match.  The competitors were the Venus (cutter-rigged boat), Last;
    Algerine (latteener), Craske; Emerald, (latteener) Col. Jones; and
    the Hornet, Everett.  The prize (an elegant silver cup) was won by
    the Venus.  At starting the Hornet had the lead for a short distance,
    when she was passed by the Venus, and on rounding the upper cross
    stake the latter boat and the Emerald were close together, and
    remained so, till they got within the Narrows, when the Colonel
    succeeded in passing her, winning the first by about half a minute.
    In two minutes after the Venus recovered her lost ground and passed
    her opponent, and succeeded in rounding the stake one minute before
    the Emerald, who, however, neared so fast that had not the Venus
    rounded the flag very closely she must have lost the match, the
    Colonel being to windward.  The oldest boater never remembers so
    closely contested a run.  After sailing, the various crafts (which
    absolutely studded the river) got under weigh, and proceeded towards
    the ancient Garianonum, opposite to which they dined.  At seven
    oâclock p.m. the boats started for home, where they arrived in about
    an hour, all safe, nothing having occurred to damp the pleasures of
    the day, which was an extremely fine one.  At Burgh, Chase, the
    spirited proprietor of the Neptune Gardens, was completely at home,
    while on the adjacent hills, opposite the cage, various groups of
    happy faces were to be seen enjoying tea, &c.  This, together with
    the immense crowd of company that congregated on the road, presented
    a scene that must have been witnessed to have been fully appreciated.
    Among the company were our worthy Mayor and a large party of
    fashionables in the handsome barge belonging to W. Fisher, Esq., S.
    T. Berney, and J. Penrice, Esqs., in the formerâs fast-sailing boat
    Meteor, Mr. Alderman Barth in the admiralâs (Greenâs) boat, &c., &c.
    This, together with the countless multitudes that crowded the decks
    of the tug, Royal Sovereign and Emperor steamers, made the river
    appear a sort of floating fair.  On the next day a number of boats,
    barges, &c., sailed to the Berney Arms to witness a rowing match (for
    a silver cup, given by Mr. Barnett, the landlord of the house) by
    four-oared gigs, which was won by the Wasp, a Norwich boat, belonging
    to William Gallant, jun.  Nearer home we observed an unusually large
    number of stalls, &c., at our bridge foot.  On the whole, there
    seemed nothing wanting to make this annual festival worthy of
    brighter days, but the presence of the Corporation barge, without
    which (although no brawlers against innovation) we cannot but think
    the Regatta is shorn of much of its glory.â

July 18th.âA fight had taken place on the Factory Denes, for one
Sovereign, between Thomas Purdy, of Caister, commonly known as âThe
Caister Champion,â and George Elliott, of Ingham.  At the 133rd round
(the battle lasted 1 h. 50 min.)  Elliott was declared the victor.

Two men (Seager and Hanson) had quarrelled in the Bear Tap, when
Nathaniel Lacey, in trying to part them, was knocked down and his leg
broken.

August 22nd.ââAs early as nine oâclock on Friday morning an immense
concourse of genteely-dressed persons had congregated before St. Peterâs
Church, anxious not to miss the opportunity of witnessing the solemn and
imposing ceremonial about to take place.  At ten oâclock the principal
door was thrown open, and this large assemblage entered.  The greatest
order and decorum prevailed, owing certainly to the excellent arrangement
of C. Symonds, Esq., one of the Churchwardens for the year, who, to
prevent confusion, had issued tickets, which were left at the houses of
the respectable housekeepers, without the least distinction, as also at
the various lodging houses for the use of the visitors.  About eleven
oâclock the Mayor (John Baker, Esq.), with the customary regalia,
attended by several other members of the Corporate body entered the
church, and were shown to the pews appropriated for their reception.  The
Bishop of Winchester soon arrived with his Chaplain and Registrar and
proceeded up the middle aisle to the altar, where the service began by
the latter gentleman presenting the petition to the Bishop, who
redelivered it to the Registrar, when it was by him read aloud.  The
Right Rev. Prelate then pronounced the following words, in a solemn,
appropriate, and sonorous tone of voiceââI am now ready to give my full
consent to that which you have desired, and may Almighty God bless the
good work in which we are about engaging.â  His Lordship then, with his
officers and clergy, walked to the west end of the church and back again
to the altar, repeating alternate versicles of the 42nd Psalm.  The
Bishop having seated himself at the table, the Deed of Consecration was
read by the surrogate (the Very Rev. the Dean of Norwich), after which
his Lordship read the exhortation, prayers, &c., appointed for the
occasion.  The usual morning prayers were read from the desk by the Hon.
and Rev. E. Pellew, with the exception of those parts especially
appropriated to the occasion, which were read by the Bishop.  The reading
Psalms most judiciously selected for the occasion were the 84th, 122nd,
and 132nd; the lessons, parts of the 8th chapter of 1st Kings, and of the
10th chapter of Hebrews.  After the prayers, verses 6, 7, and 8 of 26th,
with Gloria Patri, was performed by a very full orchestra of
instrumentalists and vocalists.  The common service was performed by the
Bishop, with the exception of the Epistle and the Nicene Creed, which
were read by his Lordshipâs Chaplain, the Rev. Alexander Dallas.  The
100th Psalm (Tate and Bradyâs version) was then sung by the whole choir.
The sermon, a striking, apposite, and eloquent one, was preached by the
Rev. Mr. Clark, the appointed minister of the Church, from Genesis,
chapter 28th, verses 16 and 17ââAnd Jacob awaketh out of his sleep, &c.â
[832 young persons were confirmed by the Bishop of Winchester.]â

August 29th.âThe Races had been held, and on âTuesday and Wednesday the
great annual main of cocks had been fought at the Bush Tavern, South
Quay, between the gentlemen of Norwich and the gentlemen of Yarmouth for
Â£5 a battle and Â£50 the odds, which was won by Norwich, who were six
battles a head.â

Sept. 15th.âThe smack Endeavour, of London, had been seized with 65 casks
and 16 bales (2,800 lbs. in weight) of tobacco on board her.

The following Corporate officers had been chosen:âJohn Danby-Palmer,
Esq., Mayor; Mr. James Jay, Chamberlain; F. R. Reynolds, Esq., and J. M.
Bell, Esq., Churchwardens.

The late gales had caused an immense quantity of sand and shingle to be
washed into the Harbour, so as to form a point opposite the South Pier.

Oct. 3rd.âThe following is the report of the Yarmouth Guild Day:â

    On Monday the Mayor and the Mayor Elect (J. Danby-Palmer, Esq.),
    accompanied by the Earl of Orford and the members of the Corporation,
    attended divine service at St. Nicholasâ Church, by the Hon. and Rev.
    Edward Pellew, after which the Rev. Thomas Baker, Chaplain to the
    Body Corporate, preached an excellent sermon.  After service the
    Corporation adjourned to the Guildhall, where the Mayor-Elect was
    sworn into office with the customary ceremonies.

    The Recorder (Mr. Sergeant Merewether) being absent, the Town Clerk,
    previous to presenting the patent of appointment as Lord High Steward
    of the Borough to the Earl of Orford, addressed his Lordship,
    observing that the Corporation entertained a high sense of the honour
    conferred upon them by his Lordshipâs acceptance of an office which
    (as constituted by one of the charters of the borough) assimilated
    with that of Lord High Steward of England, an office of great power
    and authority, having under the King the regulating the
    administration of justice, which had not since its forfeiture in the
    reign of Henry the Third, by its hereditary possessor, been granted
    to any one except upon and for particular occasions, and had only
    been presented to one of the Nobility and a Lord of Parliament.  So
    by the Charter of King Charles, the High Steward of the borough of
    Yarmouth must be âunus praeclarus vir,â the meaning of which might be
    gathered from the appointment of William, Earl of Yarmouth, to be the
    first modern High Steward, and that to the present time the office
    had been filled by noblemen distinguished by their talents and
    services as statesmen, or great naval and military commanders.
    Amongst them were the celebrated Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford,
    a second Robert Earl of Orford, and George Earl of Orford, who
    together held that office for nearly 60 years, much to the honour and
    advantage of the Borough.  Although their connection with that noble
    family had been interrupted, it had not been forgotten by the
    Corporation, who were happy in having the honour of renewing it in
    the person of his Lordship, in whom they found that âpraeclarus virâ
    pointed out by the charter, and they doubted not but that his
    Lordship would support them in all transactions grounded in honour,
    honesty, and good faith, and having for their object the public good,
    and that he would defend and maintain their ancient rights,
    privileges, and immunities.  The Town Clerk then presented Lord
    Orford with his appointment, and assured his Lordship that his
    presence among them would always be hailed with pleasure by the
    Corporation.

    The Earl of Orford was then sworn, and immediately addressed the
    Mayor and Corporation in an eloquent speech, in which he said he
    claimed no merit to himself for the choice which had been made by the
    Corporation, but attributed it solely to the recollection of the
    former connection of the borough with his ancestors, which had been
    so handsomely alluded to by the Town Clerk, and to that firm line of
    conduct in political life which he had thought it his duty
    steadfastly to pursue, which it was his pride and pleasure to
    maintain, and that although the Corporation might have selected a
    person of more influence than himself, yet he would yield to no one
    in zeal, and no exertion on his part would be spared to uphold the
    rights, privileges, and immunities of the Corporation, which had that
    day been entrusted to the Mayor, and which it was to be hoped he
    would be permitted to resign unimpaired to his successor.  He himself
    should always feel it his duty and pleasure to render his services
    available to the true interests of the borough.

    The other annual officers were then sworn, and the Mayor, accompanied
    by the High Steward and the Corporate Body, walked to the Town Hall,
    where a most splendid entertainment was provided for upwards of three
    hundred and thirty gentlemen, among whom were the Right Hon. the Earl
    of Orford, the Right Hon. Viscount Nevill, the Hon. Mr. Justice
    Alderson, the Hon. the Rev. E. Pellew, the Hon. P. H. Abbott, Sir E.
    K. Lacon, Bart., Vice-Admiral Sir George Parker, K.C.B., Col. Petre,
    Col. Mason, Robert Marsham, Esq., J. Postle, Esq., Stratton Marsham,
    Esq., E. H. K. Lacon, Esq., W. M. Praed, Esq., Rev. C. Penrice, Rev.
    J. Humfrey, Rev. â Clarke, Rev. J. Gunn, Rev. B. Winthorp, John
    Penrice, Esq., R. Rising, Esq., S. Palmer, Esq., W. Carpenter, Esq.,
    Capt. Onslow, R.N., Capt. M. Kelly, R.N., Capt. Travers, R.N., Major
    Travers, Capt. Carew, R.N., H. Munro, Esq., B. Caldecott, Esq., &c.,
    &c.

    The healths of their Majestiesâthe Princess Victoria and the rest of
    the Royal Familyâhis Majestyâs Ministers, and the Duke of Wellington,
    were drank.  On the health of the Earl of Orford being given, the
    noble Lord, in returning thanks, alluded to the commission for
    investigating Corporations, declaring âthat he denounced the
    illegality of the commission.â  His Lordship gave the health of the
    Mayor and Prosperity to the Town of Yarmouth, for which the Chief
    Magistrate expressed his acknowledgment, stating his determination to
    do all he could to forward the best interests of the town on every
    occasion.

    On the health of Mr. Justice Alderson being given, the learned Judge
    spoke of the Constitution of this country as being so framed as to
    allow all who had the talents and industry to arrive at the very
    highest dignities the King could confer, and concluded by saying that
    the question for the people to consider was whether they would close
    the avenues to those dignities.  The healths of Lord Nevill, Mr.
    Charles Palmer (the son of the Mayor), Sir E. K. Lacon, Lord Walpole
    and the House of Wolterton, Lord Wodehouse and the House of
    Kimberley, and a variety of other toasts were given; after which the
    Mayor and a large party adjourned to the Ball at the Bath Rooms,
    where dancing continued till a late hour.

Oct. 31st.ââOn Monday evening last, as Mr. Marsh, of the house of Marsh
and Barnes, wine and spirit merchants, was returning in his gig from
Beccles, he overtook a female on the road near Fritton, who, as Mr. M.
passed, implored assistance.  He pulled up, and finding the poor creature
in an exhausted and high state of nervous excitement, and that she was on
her way to this place, he took her up, when she stated as followsâthat
she had walked from Yarmouth to Heckingham House to obtain relief for a
relative residing in Yarmouth, that she had obtained 3s., was returning
home across the Marshes, and when near the New Cut and bridge over the
dam, she saw two men, who appeared to come from a wherry, and when they
met her one of them presented a pistol and threatened to shoot her, but
she answering in the negative to the enquiry of âDo you know us,â one of
them said, âDonât shoot her.â  They then searched, took from her 2s. 6d.,
some halfpence, and a handkerchief with some trifles, knocked her down by
a blow on the face, and so left her.  When she recovered she proceeded on
her journey till the above gentleman humanely assisted her into the town
and relieved her; but she was so weak from the fright as to stagger when
she left the gig.  She states that she thinks she could recognize one of
the men.  Might not some enquiry as to what wherry was moored in the Cut
at that time lead to the detection of the perpetrators of so diabolical
an act as that of distressing the distressed.  We respectfully submit to
the gentlemen who are the guardians for the hundred of Heckingham if some
safe plan could not be devised to relieve non-resident paupers, so as to
obviate the necessity of a journey by them of so many miles.â

Dec. 5th.âThe winter assemblies having been discontinued for two years
had been revived, and the first assembly had been held at the Town Hall,

few weeks since a young lady having lost her left leg by amputation, four
inches below the knee, applied to Mr. W. B. Neslen, shoe and last maker,
of this town, complaining of the inconvenience she experienced from the
wooden substitute she had procured.  Mr. N. immediately set about
remedying this, which he eventually accomplished by the making of a leg,
which for useful purposes has in a very great measure supplied the loss
of the original limb.  It was composed of light sycamore wood, cased with
leather, with elastic springs for the foot.  It was shown to several
mechanics in the neighbourhood, who all gave an opinion highly favourable
to the ingenuity of its construction.  It weighs 3lbs. (the former
substitute weighed 7lbs.) and is connected with the knee by springs.  The
lady is enabled to make very nearly the same use of the artificial as she
previously had done with the real limb.â

Oct. 2nd.âContains the following report of the proceedings on the
âMayorâs Dayâ:â

    Monday being the feast of St. Michael, the day was ushered in by
    ringing of Bells, flags at the New Hall, Church, &c.  The Mayor-Elect
    (I. Preston, jun., Esq.) ordered twopenny buns to be given to the
    children of the different charity schools in the town, and it was
    really gratifying to observe the number of happy boys and girls, with
    cheers parading Gaol-street, the Quay, &c., with their gifts in their
    hands.  About two oâclock in the afternoon the Mayor and Corporation
    attended divine service at St. Nicholasâ Church, where a sermon was
    delivered by the Rev. F. Baker (son of the Rector of Rollesby) from
    Acts, chapter 23rd, 4th and 5th verses, which in the days when
    passive obedience and non-resistance reigned might have been
    considered an excellent one.  Happily, however, those days are past,
    and few, probably, of the rev. gentlemanâs hearers accorded with him
    when they heard him denounce from the pulpit the great majority of
    those who sought Reform in the Church, and other acknowledged abuses
    as infidels, atheists, and anarchists, and those who aimed at the
    overthrow of the Church, the Altar, and the Crown.  From the Church
    the Corporation proceeded to the Guildhall, where the Mayor-Elect
    (after having taken the oath of office) spoke to the following
    effect:ââGentlemen, previous to assuming the chair of Chief
    Magistracy, which I am about to fill, you will allow me to thank you
    for the proof that you have given me of your confidence.  Gentlemen,
    I sought not this office; I have accepted it only that I might
    endeavour to render myself useful to my fellow townsmen.  Gentlemen,
    it is not the pageantry, the sword and mace (though even these may be
    of use in their way) that have allured me to this officeâno; had I
    been capable of being actuated by such motives, I should have been
    indeed unworthy of taking (as I have just taken) the Holy Gospels in
    my hand, and to have sworn before my God, to execute to the best of
    my ability, the important duties of Chief Magistrate of my native
    town.  I would now address myself to my proper brethren, I would
    address myself to all, high or low, rich or poor, and exhort them to
    do all that in their power lie to promote the decorum of social life,
    by cheeking vice, immorality, and debauchery.  Gentlemen, I thank you
    very much for the patience with which you have heard me.â  This
    address was delivered with much firmness, and at the same time with
    considerable emotion, and was received with great applause.  After
    the ceremony of robing, and the other routine business had been gone
    through, the newly-elected Mayor, Deputy-Mayor, &c., proceeded
    (escorted by the town band, flags, &c.) to the New Hall, where a
    sumptuous dinner was served to a numerous and highly respectable
    assembly of the Body Corporate, and the friends of the Chief
    Magistrate.  The dessert, which was fine and abundant, was, we
    understand, served by Mr. Brooks, of the Market Row.

Oct. 9th.âHarry Worship, Esq., had delivered a very interesting lecture
on the âPhilosophy of Dreams.â

Oct. 16th.âThe frequency of robbery at sea had induced the fishermen to
keep an unusually sharp look out.

Oct. 23rd.âCharles J. Palmer, Esq., had been elected an Alderman in the
place of Dr. Bateman, deceased.

It appears from the report of the proceedings at the Revision Court that
the lower ferry was then let at Â£30 a year only.

Oct. 30th.âThe âBluesâ claimed a gain of 50 on the revision of the
Freemanâs list.

The fishing was reported as going on âvery badly.â

Nov. 6th.âA public meeting had been held on the subject of the Port and
Haven Bill, the Mayor in the chair, when Messrs. George Danby Palmer,
Shelly, Brightwen, Ferrier, Barth, and Dowson took part in the
proceedings.

Nov. 20th.âThe Conservatives had held a meeting at Bammantâs Green, Mr.
William Mabson in the chair, pledging themselves to support the Hon. W.
H. Beresford and W. M. Praed.

Nov. 27th.âCol. Anson had spoken from the Committee Room in Regent
Street, when Messrs. George Steward and J. Shelly took part in the
proceedings.

The âPolitical Unionâ required Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold to pledge
themselves to support âCorporation Reform, Triennial Parliaments,
Extension of the Suffrage, and Vote by Ballot.â

Dec. 4th.âA meeting of voters in the Blue interest had been held at the
Crown and Anchor Tavern, when it was determined âto sink all minor
differencesâ in order to secure the return of Col. Anson and Mr. Rumbold.
Mr. N. B. Palmer addressed a crowded assembly from the Committee Rooms.

Dec. 11th.âThomas Baring, Esq., had arrived as Mr. Praedâs colleague, and
both gentlemen had addressed the electors from the Newcastle Tavern, and
a house on the South Quay, which they had engaged as a Committee Room.

Dec. 18th.âThe contest was progressing, Col. Anson assuring his
supporters âthat at that moment their canvassing book stood better than
he had ever known it to stand since he had known Yarmouth.â

Dec. 23rd.âThere had been a âviolent scuffleâ between the Reds and the
Blues, during which âthe son of a Baronet was pulled from his horse and
beaten violently.â



1835.


Jan. 8th, contains the following account of the election:â

    âIt is with feelings of the deepest sorrow that we announce that our
    late members, Messrs. Anson and Rumbold, are ousted from the
    representation.  We said last week that nothing but the most gross
    and unblushing bribery could possibly unseat these gentlemen, and
    these means have been had recourse to, to an unprecedented extent.
    Messrs. Baring and Praed are returned, not by the free and
    independent voice of the people, but by a bought majority, bought by
    means most disgraceful both to giver and receiver, although we cannot
    help thinking that the larger portion of disgrace attaches to the
    formerâfor what can be more discreditable, what can be more contrary
    to the high honour which ought to distinguish the gentleman, than to
    take advantage of the poor freeman, and by (in this instance doubly
    accursed) gold to make him forfeit his solemn promises?  Do our
    opponents ask for proofs of this?  We have them in the infamous
    system of cooping (a system which we had hoped was confined to a
    neighbouring city, but which has been now imported into this till now
    uncorrupt borough), which has been with a bold unblushing front
    carried on to a large extent in certain houses in the town.  We have
    them in the number of freemen who were to be seen on both election
    days coming up to the Red booth with Blue colours in their hats, and
    in the madness of infuriating drink, flinging them in the face of and
    grossly abusing a highly respected and respectable fellow townsman of
    ours, while at the same time they recorded their votes for Messrs.
    Baring and Praed.  We have it in the fact that four sovereigns, with
    a promise of as much more, and Â£2 10s., with a like promise, were
    given to two poor freemen of the names of Boyce and Stevenson, to
    induce them to vote for the Reds, but who, with a truly noble spirit
    that cannot be too highly appreciated, brought the money into their
    hands to the Blue booth, and then polled for Messrs. Anson and
    Rumbold.  But, unfortunately for the good cause, these glorious
    examples were not generally followed.  The Red Leaders took good care
    for the most part of their deluded and purchased victims, by plying
    them with drink, keeping them in strong hold, &c., to allow them to
    return to the paths of rectitude.  We do think that the feelings of
    our late members are rather to be envied by those of the present, the
    former having lost with honour, the latter owing their election not
    to the feeling of the town (that we confidently say, without fear of
    contradiction, is with Messrs. Anson and Rumbold), but to the
    exercise of the most abominable and venal means to effectuate it.  If
    anything like the sums which we have heard mentioned have been
    expended in this shameful warfare of gold against principle, our
    opponents may truly say with one of yore, âanother such victory will
    ruin us!â  The most active measures are being had recourse to (and
    may they be successful) either by substantiating the individual
    instances of bribery, which we know have to a great extent taken
    place to oust the members from those seats which they so unjustly
    obtained by bad means, manifestly against the feeling and real wishes
    of the town to oust Messrs. Baring and Praed from the ill-earned
    honours so surreptitiously procured for them, or at any rate to make
    the guilty individual perpetrators pay the penalty of such acts!â

    âThe nomination of the candidates took place at the Guildhall, on
    hustings erected outside.  The Town Clerk (S. Tolver, Esq.) having
    read the precept, the Mayor, in a loud voice, requested a patient
    hearing for those who might address them.  Mr. Alderman Barth, in a
    neat speech, proposed the Hon. Col Anson as a fit and proper person
    to represent the borough.  B. Dowson, Esq., seconded the nomination.
    Vice-Admiral Sir G. Parker, K.C.B., in a very manly and
    straightforward speech, proposed Mr. Rumbold, when Mr. Shelly
    presented himself as the seconder.  A picked party of his opponents,
    evidently brought there for the purpose, attempted by every
    discordant noise to prevent his being heard; by dint of perseverance,
    however, and the powerful support of his numerous friends, Mr. S.
    with even more than his usual eloquence, at considerable length
    supported the nomination.  Messrs. R. Ferrier and A. Palmer proposed
    and seconded Mr. Baring, and Mr. J. Penrice proposed and Mr. J. Lacon
    seconded the nomination of Mr. Praed.  The Hon. Col. Anson spoke at
    great length, and with all his wonted power, in the course of a
    really luminous speech, he expressed the surprise he had felt on
    finding Mr. A. Palmer (a gentleman who had before honoured him with
    his support) among the ranks of his opponents.  Mr. P. explained by
    saying it was because Col. A. had allied himself to Radicals and
    destructives.  The Hon. Col. said he was surprised at having such a
    reason assigned.  It was known to all that he had never succumbed to
    the Radicals.  That deeply grateful as he was for their support, he
    had, and should again, unless convinced of their necessity, oppose
    their great measures of vote by ballot and triennial parliaments.
    That he was so far independent appeared in this, that with the ballot
    he believed the present opposition would scarcely have occurred, or
    if it had it would have been but a very few hours ere it would have
    terminated in the triumph of himself and Mr. Rumbold.  (Loud cheers.)
    The other candidates also addressed the assembled multitude.  The
    poll commenced the following day, and from the activity with the Pink
    and Purples, or Reds, or Conservatives, for in the motley assemblage
    of coalition of colours we scarcely know what exactly they call
    themselves, brought up their voters, it was feared that they would
    head the first dayâs poll.  The event proved the correctness of the
    prediction, for at four oâclock it was found that the Tories had a
    majority of 192; although the Blues rallied next morning, that
    majority could not be altogether overcome.  The final close of the
    poll left Messrs. Baring and Praed a majority of 88.

Anson         680
Rumbold       675
Baring        772
Praed         768

    âCol. Anson and Mr. Rumbold addressed an immense concourse of
    persons, by whom they were repeatedly and loudly cheered, from the
    Kingâs Head windows.  They were preceded by Mr. Alderman Barth, Col.
    Ansonâs very deep emotion not enabling him immediately to come
    forward.  When he did come forward he said no language which he could
    use could sufficiently express his sorrow at the dissolution of the
    connection so long subsisting between them; their present members
    would find their task a comparatively easy one; they would find that
    such attention had been paid to the town that the path would be plain
    before them, and that little indeed would remain to be done.  (Loud
    cheers.)  They had been defeated by means most flagitious.  Let not
    the present members, however, be too certain of their seats, for if
    by any means these foul proceedings could be sifted to the bottom,
    measures would be taken to remove them from their ill-acquired
    honours.  With him and Mr. Rumbold, he was happy to say, still
    remained the real voice of the people.  (Cheers.)  He was proud of
    this, and would in conclusion assure them that whether in or out of
    Parliament their interests would ever have a prominent place in his
    regards.  (Loud cheers.)  Mr. Rumbold spoke under the influence of
    great agitation, and in the course of a very luminous speech adverted
    to the disgraceful fact of having in his pocket a proof that, in a
    room in this town a bribe was offered in the presence and with the
    cognizance of a Magistrate.  (Cries of âShame, shame.â)  He should
    carry into retirement with him the deepest sense of their uniform
    kindness, and a determination ever to forward the interests of any of
    his former constituents, who might apply to him, to the best of his
    ability.  The chairing of to-day was hailed by numbers with
    demonstrations which must have been the very reverse to the members;
    indeed, we are sure that if the Blues had shown in full strength
    their exasperated feelings (and they did not do this alone in
    compliance with the advice of their leaders), there could have been
    no chairing.  A dinner of our late membersâ friends is now about
    taking place at the Masonic Hall, very numerously attended.  A
    subscription for the purchase of a piece of plate for them is
    commenced, and will include the smallest amount.  This will confirm
    us in our conviction that the sense of the town is with the Blues.â

Jan. 15th.âAbout 100 supporters of Messrs. Anson and Rumbold dined at the
Masonic Hall, when both those gentlemen were present.

Jan. 22nd.âThe polling for East Norfolk showed a majority of 149 in the
town for Windham and Gurney.  Mr. Hume, M.P., Mr. Windham, and Mr. Palmer

Feb. 12th contains the following account of a sailing match from Yarmouth
to Venice:â

    âThe Lion, Punchard, having some time been considered the fastest
    ship out of this port, a brig was built, and launched in the middle
    of September, called the Vivid (Captain M. Butcher, jun.) and matched
    against the Lion, for Venice, which vessel sailed at 3 p.m. on the
    2nd of December, and the Vivid sailed at 6 p.m. on the following day,
    being 27 hours difference in favour of the former vessel; since which
    period letters have been received from Venice from each Captain,
    stating that the Vivid passed the Gut of Gibraltar on the 22nd of
    December and the Lion on the 29th.  They also state that the Vivid
    arrived at Venice on the 17th ult, and the Lion on the 24th ult.â

A meeting of the subscribers to the plate to be presented to the late
M.P.âs (Messrs. Anson and Rumbold) had been held, when it appeared that
3,685 persons had contributed Â£370 0s. 8d.

March 2nd.âMr. C. Aldred had given a lecture on the âPhilosophy of

with an off-shore wind.â

March 16th.âÂ£100 had been deposited by three gentlemen âas the issue of a
voyage to be performed by the Vivid, Lion, and Rapid, from these Roads to

Sewell, S. Cobb, and J. Shelly taking part in the proceedings.

July 2nd.âMr. Praed had presented a petition against the Corporation
Reform Bill from the town.

July 30th.âThe following notice appears of the death of J. Shelly, Esq.:â

    âIt is with feelings of more than ordinary regret that we this week
    announce the sudden death of John Shelly, Esq.  This estimable
    gentleman had concluded his examination on Tuesday forenoon last
    before the Parliamentary Committee, and after being highly
    complimented by the noble Chairman (Lord F. Egerton) for his ability
    (feeling himself somewhat unwell), had retired to his inn, where he
    directed the waiter to call him in half-an-hour.  The servant went
    upstairs at the time appointed, about two in the afternoon, and found
    Mr. S. sitting in a chair, nearly dead.  We repeat that we feel more
    than ordinary regret at having this announcement to make.  As a
    leader and representative (if we may so say) of a party his death
    will create a void that it will be long indeed ere it be filled.  His
    was a master mindâonce embarked in a subject (whatever might be its
    magnitude) it was sure to be treated powerfully and ably by Mr.
    Shelly, the whole energies of whose mind were directed to its
    elucidation for the benefit of his fellow townsmen.  There might,
    indeed, be those who excelled this really gifted man in some
    particular department, but for general knowledge, facility, power,
    ease, and even elegance of expression, our lamented friend, we should
    say, has not left his equal in this, his native town.  That he was a
    warm partizan, no one can deny, but that he was directed in his every
    movement of a public nature by sincerity and conscience is equally
    clear to every one who had the happiness of knowing him.  The great
    majority of the shops kept by those in the Liberal interest are
    shaded, to show the sense which is entertained of the irreparable
    nature of the public loss sustained.  But it is not alone in public
    that the work of Mr. S. was known.  As a father, husband, friend, and
    Christian, his conduct was alike exemplary.  We will venture to say
    that, warm as was his political partizanship, he never made himself
    one personal enemy.  Mr. Shelly has left an amiable wife and eleven
    children to deplore his loss.â

August 8th.âThe Regatta had been held, when the cup was won by Sir Jacob
Prestonâs âMariaâ; on this occasion Edmund Preston, Esq., entertained
âabout 200 of the fashionables of the town.â

August 13th.âThe petition in favour of Corporation Reform had been signed
by 2,500 persons.

August 20th.âThe following notice appears:â

    âOn Friday night, Mr. Prentice, of whose contumacy before a Committee
    of the House of Commons our readers have heard so much, arrived here,
    having been recently released from Newgate.  The day previous
    handbills made their appearance, inviting the friends of Messrs.
    Baring and Praed to accompany Prentice into town.  About seven
    oâclock on the first-mentioned evening a party of from twenty to
    thirty left the house of a publican in Chapel Street, preceded with
    band, colours, and banners down Regent Street, over the bridge, and
    so on to Hopton.  On the arrival of the âMorning Starâ coach Prentice
    was taken out and placed in an open landau, in which he stood
    upright, bowing, as he went along, to the assemblage, which by this
    time had become very large, induced thereto by the novelty of the
    scene.  The procession with much mock gravity moved on to the bridge,
    by torch light, went round the town, and thence proceeded to the
    Bowling Green, where the lion of the night spoke from a window.  He
    described the present as the proudest, the happiest day of his
    lifeâsaid that although the Reform Bill had given him a vote, yet he
    hated it,âhe hated also the Corporation Reform Bill, and hoped that
    the Lords would so mutilate it that Lord John Russell might not know
    his own child again.â

October 8th contains the following paragraph:â

    âSome admirers of the Corporation met on Tuesday senânight to
    celebrate Michaelmas Day at the Angel Inn, Mr. F. Paget in the chair.
    We understand that some of the leading members of the expiring body
    were present.â

October 18th contains a notice of Brockâs miraculous escape from
drowning.

Oct. 22nd.âThe first Oddfellowsâ funeral in this town is thus recorded:â

    âOn Thursday afternoon last the novel ceremonial of an Oddfellowsâ
    funeral took place in processional order.  The deceased, Nathaniel
    Spilman, had been for many years a member of the two lodges in this
    town, and, it having been his request, he was interred with the usual
    honours appertaining to the Order.  Accordingly, the brethren of the
    two lodges proceeded in the following order to the house of the
    deceased:âofficer of the lodge with his drawn sword, secretary
    bearing the scroll, two officers with their wands, two of the head
    officers of each lodge, two officers with wands, two of the second
    officers of the lodges, a large concourse of the brethren adorned
    with their numerous silver medals, aprons, &c., two of the wardens
    carrying their badges.  On their arrival at the house they proceeded
    to the churchyard in the above order, with the addition of the Hon.
    and Rev. Edward Pellew preceding the body, which was carried by six
    of the brethren of the lodge, with six others as pall-holders,
    wearing their different medals and aprons.  When at the grave the
    Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew read the burial service, and at the
    conclusion the scroll was thrown in, each of the brethren throwing in
    sprigs of rosemary.  The secretary to both lodges read the funeral
    obsequies over the grave.  They then returned to the house of the
    deceasedâs relatives, and after leaving the family (who had attended
    the remains to the grave) proceeded in the same order to the
    lodge-room, where they soon after separated.  Certainly nothing could
    have been more solemn and impressive than was the whole of this
    ceremonial.  At a meeting of the brethren on the Monday following, it
    was unanimously resolved, that the secretary should issue a circular
    to the Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew, thanking him for the great
    condescension and kindness evinced by him in attending the funeral of
    their late departed brother.â

Nov. 5th.âA meeting to consider the question of constructing a railway
had been held.  Admiral Sir G. Parker, William Barth, Esq., Ambrose
Palmer, Esq. (who prognosticated that by means of a railway the fisheries
would become so immense as to be the astonishment of all), R. S.
Lonsdale, Esq., R. Ferrier, Esq., R. Palmer Kemp, Esq., and others took
part in the proceedings.

Nov. 12th.âThe following gentlemen had been nominated by the Whig party

issued a joint address in the South Ward; R. Ferrier and F. Preston had
offered themselves for the St. Georgeâs and St. Andrewâs Wards, and R.

tonnage of which amounted to 24,933 tons, and with cargoes âoutwardsâ 120
vessels, of a tonnage of 8,560 tons.  The âOld Spring,â a ship of nearly
400 tons (belonging to George Danby Palmer, Esq.), had arrived from
Archangel with timber, and came up to the Quay without unlading any part
of her cargo.

Dec. 10th.âThe retiring Aldermen (except Mr. Barth) were entertained by
their Tory friends previous to their quitting office.

    It is a matter of great congratulation that 34 out of the 36
    Councillors are Reformers.  This election was conducted with
    tranquility.  Devoutly it is to be wished that parliamentary
    elections were managed in the same way.  The laborious portion of our
    population had no inducement held out to them to lose a single hour.
    It is a little curious that Mr. William Prenticeâthat very Mr.
    Prentice who made so conspicuous a figure in our election
    parliamentary investigation, proved one of the most formidable
    antagonists with whom the Liberal candidates in the town had to
    contend.â

Jan. 7th.âThe first meeting of the Reformed Corporation is reported as
follows:â

    âThe Town Council met on Thursday last at the Tolhouse Hall, John
    Brightwen, Esq., in the chair, (Isaac Preston, Esq., having, we
    understand, ceased to exercise the functions of Mayor since his
    publication of the Council List), for the purpose of choosing twelve
    Aldermen.  The choice fell on the following gentlemen:âMessrs. J.
    Brightwen, Benjamin Dowson, Robert Teasdel, Joseph Starling, J. B.
    Palmer, R. S. Lonsdale, Thomas Pitt, Captain William Larke, R.N.,
    Benjamin Fenn, Robert Wall, Christopher Nicholls, and Captain James
    Jefferies.  On the following day the Aldermen and Council met at the
    same place for the election of a Mayor and for other public business.
    Mr. E. H. L. Preston proposed Mr. Richard Hammond.  Mr. H. thanked
    Mr. P. for the proposition, and said that he should still more thank
    his friends if they voted against him.  William Barth, Esq., was then
    chosen Mayor, amidst loud cheering.  Mr. B. was then, together with
    the Aldermen, sworn in.  The Court was then thrown open to the
    public, when the front and side galleries were instantly filled by a
    very respectable concourse of persons, the body of the hall being
    appropriated to the Council.  Several gentlemen were named for
    Magistrates to be recommended to the Crown.  Accounts were ordered
    touching the property (and profits arising from such property) held
    by the late Corporation, together with accounts of the official
    persons employed, their salaries, &c., for the last five years.  J.
    Tolver, Esq., was then chosen, during pleasure, as Town Clerk.â

    âOur Conservatives had dined together on Thursday to celebrate the
    anniversary of the return of Messrs. Baring and Praed.  They have
    been obliged to put themselves on a level with the Reformers, and be
    content with three shilling tickets instead of fifteen.  The dinner
    took place at the Angel Inn, J. E. Lacon, Esq., in the chair.â

Jan. 14th contains the following report:â

    âThere was an unusual quantity of business transacted at the
    Corporation Assembly on Wednesday last.  It was first proposed that a
    petition should be addressed to the King, praying for four Sessions
    of Oyer and Terminer a year.  It was suggested that the Recorder
    should be allowed Â£60 a year.  To this Mr. E. L. Preston objected,
    who moved that it should be Â£50.  To this it was replied that the
    latter sum was allowed by the late Corporation when Sessions were
    only held twice a year.  The original motion was carried unanimously,
    Mr. E. Sewell observing that Mr. Pâs was a false economy.  It was
    next moved by Mr. S. Cobb that the Great Seal should be called that
    of the Town Council, and not of St. Nicholas.  He had no objection to
    all remaining as it was except the expensive name of St. Nicholas.
    This was warmly opposed by Mr. Preston.  It was, however, carried
    unanimously.  Mr. Richard Hammond read a list of persons to form the
    Committee of Finance.  To this plan Mr. Preston warmly objected,
    saying he had no notion of names being got up âready cut and dried.â
    It was stated in answer that the list (to which no objection was then
    made) was agreed to at the Watch Committee, of which Mr. P. formed
    one, and which he might have attended if he pleased.  Mr. B.
    Sherrington (of the same politics as Mr. P.) was on the Committee,
    and was present.  The Finance Committee agreed to were, the Mayor
    (who is appointed _ex-officio_ on all Committees), Messrs. S. Cobb,
    R. S. Lonsdale, Charles Nicholls, B. Dowson, Martin, G. D. Palmer, C.
    Sayers, W. Johnson, and Burroughs.  On the Mayor explaining the
    duties of the Borough Lands Committee, it was suggested and agreed
    to, that the tradesmen employed solely by this Committee should be
    only for small jobs.  This being a most important business, it was
    determined that all the Council should form the Committee.  On the
    Water-Bailiffs and Met Farm Office Committee, it was resolved, on the
    motion of Mr. S. Cobb, that it be called âCommittee of Port Duesâ;
    the officer âCollector of Port Dues.â  The Committee appointed were
    Messrs. W. Barber, G. D. Palmer, T. Pitt, R. Teasdel, Martin, J. B.
    Palmer, Thomas Hammond, Fenn, Butcher, and Dowson.  Market and
    Corporation Tollsâ Committee: Messrs. Johnson, Brightwen, S. Cobb,
    Sayers, Nicholls, Sherrington, R. Hammond, S. Palmer, Symonds, J. B.
    Palmer, and Martin.  Committee for Caister Causeway: Messrs. R. P.
    Kemp, S. Palmer, Nicholls, Fenn, Tomlinson, R. Hammond, and Sayers.
    Church Trustees: Messrs. Larke, Kemp, Burroughs, J. Dowson, Starling,
    B. Cobb, S. Palmer, E. N. Clowes, Marsh, Tomlinson, Garson, Grave,
    Butcher, Barber, Robinson, Preston, Martin, Symonds, Sherrington, and
    G. D. Palmer.  All the outstanding drawbacks arc to be referred to
    the Port Dues Committee.  The ringersâ bill, Â£12 10s. for five daysâ
    ringing, was disallowed.  Admiralty Court: R. Cory, jun., returned
    that he had in five years received as registrar Â£1,483 16s. 8d., and
    claimed as compensation Â£200 per year for his natural life.
    Proctors: C. J. Palmer claimed Â£1,036 7s., C. Sayers Â£1,196 5s. 6d.,
    I. Preston Â£692, E. R. Palmer Â£497.  Thomas King, gaoler, petitioned
    for continuance of place, stated emoluments, and asked Â£13 7s. 4Â½d.
    compensation, as Marshall of the Court of Admiralty.  Mrs. King, as
    matron, received Â£10 per year, and prayed to be continued.  Alfred
    King, turnkey, received 14s. per. week, and prayed for continuance.
    The five sergeants-at-mace sent a return of their emoluments for five
    years, and petitioned for their continuance.  B. Welsh, chapel clerk,
    made about Â£47 per year, and prayed for continuance.  The Rev. Thomas
    Baker, as lecturer, received Â£120 per year.  The Hon. and Rev. E.
    Pellew received from the late Corporation Â£40 per year and a house,
    for which he pays 1s. per year rent.  John Seaman, parish clerk,
    receives no salary, but averages about Â£80 per annum.  The Revs. J.
    Homfray and Mark Waters declined the statement of their proceeds, as
    they conceived the returns did not apply to them as Ministers of a
    Chapel endowed by Act of Parliament.  They begged their refusal might
    not be considered as arising from discourtesy.  Their communication
    was rejected.  These returns were referred to a Committee of the
    Mayorâs assistants.â

Jan. 21st.âThe Earl of Orford had been removed from his office of High
Steward and the Earl of Lichfield elected in his place.

The following gentlemen were suggested as Magistrates:âWilliam Barth,
Esq., Sir George Parker, K.C.B., George Danby Palmer, H. V. Worship, J.
Brightwen, C. Nicholls, R. Palmer Kemp, S. Cobb, and S. Palmer, Esqs.,
and Capt. Larke, R.N., by the Council.

Sixteen new watch and policemen, and two superintendents had been
appointed.

âThe Mayor with no other insignia of office than the chain and the sword
carried by an officer.â

Feb. 4th.âThe Tories had held a dinner in the Theatre in honour of
Messrs. Baring and Praed.  Seven hundred persons attended.

Feb. 18th.âHas the following report of a high tide:â

    âThe scene of devastation on our beach, occasioned by the late high
    tides, exceed the powers of description.  Wednesday morning, in some
    measure, prepared us for the event; the sea was at that time breaking
    over the jetty, and reached as high as the houses.  It was prophesied
    by nautical men that if the next tide was equally high the
    consequences would be most disastrous, and, unfortunately, it so
    proved.  The sea in the evening undermined the foundations of most of
    the dwellings, throwing down the walls of many, to the great injury
    of those of the inmates who had not taken the precautions to remove
    their property.  Furniture was seen floating in all directions, in
    the presence of the astonished and alarmed multitude.  The summer
    residence of the Right Hon. Lord Berners is more than half destroyed,
    while the house of the Misses Ansell and the Right Hon. Lord Nevill
    were surrounded; in fact, such a scene of general devastation never
    in the memory of the oldest inhabitant presented itself.  The sea at
    one time reached some way up the Jetty Road.  While a person was
    assisting the landlord of the Holkham Tavern to remove his beds, &c.,
    to a back warehouse, the sea burst in and broke down the front wall.
    At one part of the South Denes the sea and river might be seen
    meeting.  Part of the South Quay was flooded.  It was unusually high
    at the bridge, and likewise some of the lower parts of the town.
    Amidst this wide spreading destruction, we are glad to say, no lives
    were lost.â

Feb. 22nd.âThe Lord High Steward (the Earl of Lichfield) had been sworn
in, and a dinner given in his honour.  The noble lord was accompanied by
the Mayor, Lord Suffield, the Hon. George Anson, Mr. Rumbold, Sir W.
Ffolkes, and Mr. Adair.

March 10th.âA meeting had been held, the Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew
presiding, to consider the establishment of a penny library for the
working classes.

March 24th.âA bet had been made by Mr. Ringer, of the Elephant and Castle
liquor shop in the Market Place, âthat on Monday he would sell 1,000
glasses of ale and porter from six oâclock in the morning and close the
same night.  Mr. R. closed at 10, after selling 2,454, at one penny per
glass.â

Mr. F. Preston had launched a fine ship of 370 tons from his yard.

April 2nd.âMr. Edward H. L. Preston and Mr. Green had been tried and

Sir E. Lacon              207
Samuel Paget              168

and Messrs. Palmer and Barth were consequently elected.

April 14th contains the following paragraph as to the recent bribery
prosecution:â

    âYesterday there was a grand public dinner at the Angel Inn, to
    celebrate what the Tories call âthe defeat of the Attorney-General
    and the Yarmouth Radicals;â but what we should say was a fortunate
    escape of the accused parties, arising from the glorious uncertainty
    of the law.  John Lacon, Esq., was in the chair.  Richard Ferrier,
    Esq., presided at the left hand table.  The two vice-presidents were
    Mr. Aldred and Mr. John Clarke.  A very handsome silver teapot and
    ewer were presented to Mr. William Green, by John Penrice, Esq., in
    an appropriate speech, for his exertions at the last election.  We
    were not present, but had these particulars from a Tory friend, who
    also said âhe thought âtwas hard poor Prentice hadnât something, as
    he did as much as Green, and more too.â  There were about 70 persons
    present.â

Twenty gentlemen, all of Reform principles, had been elected select
Vestrymen.

Five hundred merchants and others had attended a public meeting to
protest against the proposal of the Eastern Countiesâ Railway Company to
construct a line to Harwich.

June 17th.âNathaniel Palmer, Esq., had been appointed Recorder.

June 23rd.âA fine new schooner (The Clipper) had been launched for
William Hurry Palmer, Esq., and was expected to be the fastest sailing
vessel out of the port.

June 30th.âThe Cross was ordered to be pulled down.

July 14th.âIt was stated that âYarmouth is very full of strangers, who
flock here from all parts of the country to enjoy the cool sea breezes.
We believe there is not any other place that affords so excellent a view
of shipping in motion as Yarmouth Roads, it being the great thoroughfare
for all vessels trading to the North.  The Bath Room is one of the
principal attractions to visitors, as it is a most agreeable lounge
during the heat of the day, and frequent undress balls enliven the
youthful part of the company.  The Bath Room has been well attended this
year, and we are happy to say the list of subscribers gives promise of a
good season.â

The destruction of the Cross is thus noticed:â

    âOn Friday last the Market Cross was sold by public tender for Â£55
    6s., and on Monday morning workmen commenced pulling it down.  It has
    now entirely disappeared, to the gratification of the residents in
    the Market Place, to whom it had long been a great annoyance, in
    consequence of its having become a rendezvous for idle and dissolute
    persons.  The Tories lament the loss of it, and call the Corporation
    destructives for having removed a public nuisance!  We know not what
    claim it had upon their sympathies, except in being a fit emblem of
    the late Body Corporate, for like that it perhaps was of service at
    some bygone period of time, but having long ceased to be useful, it
    had fallen to abuse and rottenness, and to complete the resemblance
    it has, after some struggles, been swept away by the current of
    public opinion.â

August 9th.âThe Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew had been presented with plate of
the value of Â£100 by the parishioners.

August 25th.âThe Races had been held, the Stewards being the Earl of
Orford, Lord Henniker, and T. Baring, Esq., M.P.  About 160 ladies and
gentlemen attended the Race Ball, and 2,000 persons patronized the
Vauxhall Gardens.

Sept. 1st.âThe Regatta had been held, and the Theatre had been well
filled on the Stewardsâ bespeak, when an attempt to get up a cry of
âBaring and Rumboldâ proved a failure.

Sept. 22nd.â172 persons holding Corporation leaseholds had intimated
their desire to purchase the freehold of their properties, at prices
amounting to Â£6,911.

Oct. 6th.âThe price of herrings was Â£23 to Â£24 per last.

Oct. 13th.âThe compensation awarded to the Town Clerk for loss of his
offices of Magistratesâ Clerk and Clerk of the Peace had been settled at
Â£222 per annum.

Nov. 3rd.âThe result of the Municipal Election is reported as follows:â

    âOur Municipal Election took place on Tuesday last.  The contest in
    the St. Nicholasâ Ward was a severe one.  It was neck and neck
    between Mr. Nuthall and E. H. L. Preston all day.  At length the
    election was carried by a _worthy_, who, after promising constantly
    to vote for Nuthall and Sherrington, was suddenly not to be found;
    but about five minutes before the close of the poll he was brought
    out of the Saracenâs Head, a low public-house, in a state of
    intoxication, his voting paper having been changed or altered to
    Preston and Fiddes.  This decided the thing in Mr. Prestonâs favour,
    as before that time the numbers for him and Mr. Nuthall were 102
    each.  Such a mode of gaining an election is quite in keeping with
    Tory practices, and needs no comment.  The validity of the election
    is, however, disputed on the grounds of a bad vote on the Tory side,
    and an informality in the appointment of an Alderman to preside in
    the absence of the Aldermen of the Ward.  The following is a list of
    Councillors returned:â_St. Nicholasâ Ward_: Mr. Sherrington and Mr.
    Preston.  _Market_: Mr. E. N. Clowes and Mr. Sewell.  _Regent_: Mr.
    Cufaude Davie and Mr. John Fish.  _St. Georgeâs_: Mr. Worship and Mr.
    Lettis.  _Nelson_: Mr. Robinson and Mr. Symonds.  _St. Andrewâs_: Mr.
    Martin and Mr. Frederick Preston.â

Nov. 10th.âA dinner, attended by 200 gentlemen, had been given to William
Barth, Esq. (the Mayor.)

such petition:âThe Hon. E. Grimshaw, Charles Rushout, H. Thomas, E.
Baker, W. C. Brodie, J. C. Holmes, and J. Bailey (Tories), and J. E.
Vivian, R. W. Hunt Lord M. Hill, and the Hon. George Byng (Whigs).

May 3rd.âThis Committee had come to the resolutionâThat C. E. Rumbold and
W. Wilshere, Esqs., are duly elected, but that the petition was not
frivolous or vexatious.

May 10th.âThis decision appears to have been the result of an arrangement
made by a few gentlemen of the Whig and Tory parties, that one of the
members (it is believed Mr. Wilshere) would accept the Chiltern Hundreds
at the end of the present Session of Parliament.  It was believed in that
event Mr. Baring would be opposed.  It is stated that âof late our
members have not reposed on a bed of roses.â

May 17th.âThe schooner âStamboulâ had been launched from Messrs. A.
Palmer and Sonâs yard.

May 24th.âA suggestion appears to found a Dispensary in Yarmouth and that
the Council fund should be applied towards this end.  This fund then
consisted of Â£2,500, and was formed by the contributions of each Alderman
of Â£10 and each Common Councilman Â£5 on his election.

May 31st.âThe âPantaloon,â a fine, large, round-sterned brig of 180 tons,
had been launched by her owners, Messrs. A. and G. Steward; and the
âVictoria,â 350 tons, by Mr. J. Preston.

A meeting had been held at the Town Hall to consider the propriety of
establishing a small Hospital for Great Yarmouth and the East and West
Fleggs and Mutford and Lothingland Hundreds.  The Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew
presided, and amongst those present were all the resident clergy and
medical gentlemen of the town, with Messrs. G. D. Palmer, Brightwen, W.
Steward, B. Dowson, Worship, &c.

June 7th and 14th.âCol. Thompson had been suggested as a candidate for
the Borough, and Mr. Northhouse had addressed a meeting on his behalf.
Mr. George Steward was taking an active part in this affair.

June 21st.âSuggestions were being made for the celebration of the Queenâs
Coronation.

Messrs. Henry Emms and William Simms had been appointed Relieving
Officers.

The donations for the proposed Hospital were Â£200 and the annual
subscriptions Â£280.

June 28th.âThis issue contains the following account of how, after a
futile effort had been made by the Vicar, which appears not to have been
a success, H.M. Coronation was celebrated.  At an âadjourned meeting of
the subscribers to the fund for celebrating her Majestyâs Coronation, by
giving a dinner to the poor children of the town on that day, held at the
New Hall, on Thursday evening last, the Hon. and Rev. E. Pellew in the
chair, those gentlemen who had undertaken to collect subscriptions
reported that they had scarcely any further funds to add to those already
collected.  Under these circumstances the chairman submitted to the
meeting that the proposed plan of feasting the children was a failure
from the want of funds.  Considerable discussion then ensued as to the
propriety of taking steps towards celebrating the Coronation day in any
other way, upon which there were many conflicting opinions.  At length
Mr. Samuel Palmer, after recapitulating all that had been done, and
regretting that up to that time nothing had been realized, movedââThat a
subscription be now entered into, to provide such amusements for the poor
of the town on the day of the Coronation as may seem fit to the
subscribers, and that a committee be appointed to carry the same into
effect.â  Mr. Samuel Barber moved, as an amendment, âthat all the poor of
the town be regaled with roast beef and plum puddingâ; but it appearing
to the meeting that as money enough could not be raised to regale the
children, it would be impossible to raise a sufficient sum to feast all
the poor.  The amendment was negatived, and Mr. Palmerâs motion was
unanimously carried.  The Chairman then left the chair, and Mr. George
Danby Palmer was called on to preside, when thanks were voted to the late
Chairman; a spirited subscription was begun in the room; a committee was
appointed to carry Mr. Palmerâs motion into effect, and the meeting
separated.â

âSince that time the gentlemen composing the committee have collected
money to the amount of about Â£200, and a bill of fare has been issued
sports and entertainments to take place on the South Denes, amongst which
are horse, pony, and donkey races, jumping in sacks, climbing matches,
and running after pigs with soaped tails.  There will also be sailing
matches on the river.  A dinner will take place in a marquee erected on
the ground, the Mayor in the chair.  A stand and several booths have also
been built for the accommodation of the public.  The amusements will
conclude with a superb display of fireworks, under the direction of an
artist from London.â

July 7th contains the following record of the result of such action:â

    The festivities and sports which were to have taken place on Thursday
    last in honour of the Coronation were interrupted by a heavy fall of
    rain, which commenced at the hour fixed for the fun to begin, and
    continued nearly, âsansâ intermission, until night.  This untoward
    state of the elements prevented any very great assembly of multitude
    taking place; nevertheless there were some two or three thousand
    determined holiday-makers congregated on the South Denes, and the
    horse and pony races came off in spite of the unfavourable state of
    the weather.  The race for hacks was well contested and won by
    Highflyer, beating Whiscumsnivet, the Ambassador, and Sir William.
    The pony race was also a good one; we could not learn the name of the
    winner.  Four boats started for the silver cupâvalue Â£7âviz., the
    Coriander (Balls), Leviathian (Preston), Louisa (Fiddis), and Neptune
    (Green).  The wind was light at starting, and towards the end of the
    match there was so little as scarcely to fill the sails; the
    Coriander won by about half a length.  The remainder of the sports
    were postponed until Friday afternoon.  At four oâclock upwards of
    100 gentlemen sat down to dinner in a marquee erected on the Denes,
    the Mayor (Dr. Penrice) in the chair.  After dinner the health of the
    Queen was drunk with long, loud, and hearty cheers, and the usual
    loyal and patriotic toasts were given; several excellent songs were
    sung, and about half-past ten the company returned to the town
    preceded by a band of music.  The children at the various charity
    schools and the inmates of the Fishermenâs Hospital were handsomely
    entertained.  The Temperance people had a tea meeting, and all, as
    far as the weather would permit, appeared to enjoy themselves in
    their own way.

    On Friday afternoon, at three oâclock, the sports were re-commenced,
    the weather being most propitious and the sun shining with surpassing
    brilliancy.  Yarmouth poured out thousands upon thousands of its
    working population, and great numbers of all classes were present to
    witness the fun and partake of the amusement of the day.  The
    performances, if so they may be called, took place on a stage
    immediately opposite the stand, which was filled with spectators,
    under the superintendence and direction of a gentleman, to whose good
    humoured exertions too much praise cannot be given, and who was ably
    assisted by others in providing and bringing out such entertainments
    for the humbler classes as seemed best adapted to their taste and
    habits.  First came two chimney sweeps in _full costume_; they dived
    in a tub of meal for pieces of money, which they picked out with
    their mouths.  Numberless sneezings and many collisions of sooty
    heads, now, however, converted into floury nobs, took place during
    this match, to the great merriment of the assembled crowds; at length
    the money was all abstracted, and the performers, well washed, made
    their bows and retired from the stage.  Next came bobbing for oranges
    in tubs of water, by boys with their hands tied behind them.  Then a
    singing match by boys, which was won by an urchin of the name of John
    Hutchin, who sung two comic songs with inimitable humour and effect.
    A horn pipe match followed, in which the best dancers made up by
    agility for what was wanting in grace and elegance.  Grinning through
    horse collars succeeded, and here one Billy Derry out-uglied the
    ugliestâO! for grinning through a horse collar, commend me to Billy
    Derry.  Then we had six old women, drinking scalding hot tea for a
    prize of one sovereign; the efforts of these poor old creatures to
    gulp down the almost boiling fluid, were at once both pitiable and
    ludicrous, but they appeared to enjoy the parts they were acting
    almost as much as the spectators did, who gave way to the most
    uproarious laughter we ever remember to have heard, they were all
    well rewarded for their exhibition.  There were also donkey races,
    climbing soaped poles, gingling matches, running wheelbarrows
    blindfold, a rowing match, and races after pigs with their tails
    soaped, and twenty-four barrels of ale were given away to the
    populace on the ground.  At half-past ten at night the Market Place
    was literally crammed with people to witness the display of
    fireworks, which was splendid and worthy of the occasion, and
    concluded the Coronation amusements.  Immediately after the fireworks
    had ceased the crowd dispersed, and by twelve oâclock the streets
    were as quiet as upon ordinary occasions.

July 14th.âThe Corporation had voted an address to the Queen, of which
the following is the notice:â

    âAt an assembly of the Corporation, held on Wednesday, the Mayor read
    a congratulatory address to Her Majesty the Queen, upon the
    Coronation, which was unanimously adopted by the Council, and Mr.
    Barth, Mr. Robert Palmer Kemp and Mr. Samuel Palmer, were appointed a
    deputation to carry up and present the same; it being left to the
    option of any other gentlemen of the Council to join the deputation.â

The Mayor, preceded by the Regalia, had walked to church, âunaccompanied
by a single member of the Town Council.â

July 5th.âCol. Thompson had declined to come forward.

honour of the Coronation.  There were 34 competitors, and it was won by
Mr. John Porrett, âthe veteran bowler.â

July 12th.âA meeting of freemen to oppose Mr. Baringâs return at the
ensuing election had been held at the Masonic Hall, Mr. Joseph Bayly
(Chairman).  Capt. Love, Mr. John Clowes, jun., Mr. Lawrence, and Mr.
Charles Marsh took part in the proceedings, and the following gentlemen
were appointed a committee to carry the resolutions passed at the meeting
into effect:âMessrs. Joseph Bayly, John Clowes, jun., S. Cobb, E. R.

canvassing the electors.  At the nomination the former gentleman was
proposed and seconded by Mr. J. Lacon and Mr. E. H. L. Preston, and the

representing Mr. Wilshere.  Mr. Baring then addressed the electors.  The
result of the poll was declared to beâ

For Wilshere       735
Baring             702

A very painful occurrence had happened.  A poor fellow âwho took some
part in the electionâ declared that if Mr. Baring lost the election he
would hang himself.  The poll closed at 4, and he had effectually hung
himself and was cut down before 5 oâclock.

1839.


Jan. 3rd.âThe first half-yearly meeting of the governors and subscribers
to the Hospital had been held, and is reported as follows:â

    âOn Friday the first half-yearly meeting of the governors and
    subscribers to the Hospital was held at the Town Hall, the Hon. and
    Rev. Edward Pellew in the chair.  Mr. A. Drew was unanimously elected
    resident Dispenser, at a salary of Â£60 per annum.  Some alterations
    of the rules were agreed upon.  Mr. S. S. Barber then moved that the
    votes for officers to the institution should be taken by ballot, and
    not by voting papers, as at the first meeting, which was lost by a
    majority of 17 to 13.  It is intended to bring the question forward
    again at the next meeting.  The Rev. J. North, honorary secretary to
    the institution, stated that at the last yearly meeting of the old
    Dispensary, in October, it was resolved that an application be made
    to the subscribers to the Hospital for a grant from their funds to
    discharge the additional bills.  At Lady-day last they had moved into
    the house at present used for the Hospital.  They soon felt they
    could not maintain the increased expenditure with the same funds, and
    a meeting was called of the subscribers, when the proposition was
    first started for the Hospital, and in the end the Hospital was
    established.  At the close of the year, owing to circumstances over
    which he could not say who had the control, it was found that the
    managers of the Dispensary could not pay their liabilities by Â£33.
    They had furniture which was valued at Â£7 10s., leaving them minus
    Â£25 10s. 0Â¼d.  He now asked whether they would make a grant of that
    amount from the funds of the Hospital.  B. Dowson, Esq., proposed
    that a transfer be made of that sum to defray the deficiency, the new
    institution having been established on the old one.  C. Nichols,
    Esq., seconded it on the further ground that the old institution had
    deferred several applications for assistance for the benefit of the
    Hospital, such as sermons at church, &c.  Mr. North said all their
    funds had been merged into those of the Hospital.  John Lacon, Esq.,
    thought it would be better to raise the sum among themselves, which
    proposition, after a great deal of discussion, was ultimately
    carried, and 13 sovereigns were subscribed in the room.  The decision
    was extremely satisfactory to all the new subscribers to the
    Hospital.â

A very handsome vessel named the âJenny Jonesâ had been launched from Mr.
F. Prestonâs yard.

Jan. 10.âEdward Woodrow, baker, had been committed for trial on the
prosecution of the Guardians, for selling them short weight bread for the

Guardians because they had presented a Christmas dinner to the paupers,

Â£50, which he paid, but ânot until the Recorder (N. Palmer, Esq.) had
twice threatened to commit him for contempt of Court.â

Feb. 14th.âThe Town Council adopted a petition for the abolition of the

July 4th contains the following as to the Yarmouth Hospital and
Dispensary:â

    The first annual meeting of this Institution was held at the Town
    Hall on Friday last, on which occasion the Worshipful the Mayor was
    in the chair.  He felt gratified by the honour that meeting had done
    him in calling him to the chair.  In looking over the programme of
    the meeting, he found the accounts were to be auditedâthey were
    requested to pay their subscriptions, to elect annual officers, and
    to take into consideration the erection or purchase of a building for
    a new Hospital.

    William Steward, Esq., read abstracts from the secretary and
    treasurerâs books, by which it appeared that the benefactions
    amounted to Â£292 9s. 6d., subscriptions to Â£435 19s., and interest at
    the bankers Â£8 15s. 2d., and that there had been expended for fitting
    up and furniture, Â£141 8s. 10d.; for housekeeping, salaries, and
    wages, Â£94 15s. 9d.; chemistsâ bills, drugs, &c., Â£90 15s.; books,
    stationery, and printing, Â£35 14s. 9d.; rent and incidentals, Â£33 3s.
    1d.; leaving a balance in treasurerâs hands of Â£341 6s. 3d.  Mr.
    Steward stated that the accounts had been made out with great care,
    and examined by two auditors.  The total number of patients that had
    been admitted from October 1st, 1838, to June 1st, 1839, was 532,
    being 35 in and 439 out-patients, of whom 5 in and 9 out remained on
    the books.

    J. Tidswell, Esq., moved that the report now read be received, that
    it be ordered to be printed, and a copy placed in the hands of each
    of the subscribers, which was seconded by the Rev. W. F. Clarke, and
    carried unanimously.

    The meeting then proceeded to the election of such officers as retire
    annually, when all the old officers were unanimously elected, with
    one alteration.  The Rev. M. Waters, who had been on the Committee,
    having accepted the office of honorary secretary, _vice_ Rev. J.
    North, who had left the town, J. Tidswell, Esq., was chosen in his
    room.

    The Chairman said the next business was of considerable importance.
    It was to consider the propriety of erecting or purchasing a building
    for the use of the Institution.

    William Steward, Esq., would submit to the meeting a proposal he held
    in his hand, which was to raise a building fund of Â£1,000, in shares
    of Â£10 each, on which interest at Â£3 per cent. per annum is to be
    paid till the fund will enable them to liquidate it; and in the
    interim every shareholder to have the right of recommending one
    out-patient for each share annually.  One object in raising the fund
    now was, that they had Â£151 in hand from the benefactions, and Mr.
    Anguish had sent them Â£50 towards the building fund.  The interest
    would not amount to what they now paid for rent.  They hoped the
    Corporation would grant them an eligible site for the intended new
    building.

    The Rev. M. Waters was sure there would be no difficulty in raising
    the required fund, as they would soon have Â£300 paid in donations,
    which would prevent any risk to the shareholders.

    The Chairman suggested that it would be better first to resolve that
    it would be expedient to erect or purchase a building, and then to
    submit the means for raising the money, in which opinion J.
    Brightwen, Esq., fully concurred, when

    Mr. S. S. Barber proposed, that it is the opinion of this meeting
    that it is expedient that an Hospital should be built, which was
    seconded by Mr. E. H. L. Preston.

    Mr. W. S. Lacon thought it premature to build at present; the
    Hospital had only been in operation a few months, and at the last
    meeting, when certain resolutions were proposed, certain gentlemen,
    who did not like those resolutions, said they would withdraw.  He
    would propose that the consideration of the question be postponed to
    that day twelve months, which was seconded by Dr. Sabine.

    J. G. Fisher, Esq., thought the building of an Hospital would promote
    the object they had in view, and could not agree with Mr. Lacon, in
    which he was supported by the Rev. M. Waters.

    The amendment being put, only six voted for it, and the original
    motion was carried.

    Mr. E H. L. Preston then proposed that the plan for raising a fund,
    as proposed by Mr. Steward, be adopted, and that a paper be laid on
    the table to receive the names of persons willing to take shares,
    which was seconded by Mr. Barber.

    J. G. Fisher, Esq., proposed the thanks of the meeting to the Mayor
    for his conduct in the chair, which was carried by acclamation.

    The Mayor, in returning thanks, expressed his determination to do all
    in his power to procure them an eligible spot on which to erect the
    new edifice.  Those present having paid their subscriptions, the
    meeting separated.

1840.


Jan. 2nd contains the following as to âYarmouth Hospitalâ:â

    The half-yearly meeting of the governors of this institution was held
    at the Town Hall on Saturday.  William Steward, Esq., took the chair,
    and stated that the building was expected to be completed for the
    reception of patients by Lady-day.  The cost of the building,
    including furniture and the tower (a very ornamental building, to be
    used as a look-out), with other incidental charges, would amount to
    Â£1,600.  (Expressions of surprise, and âWhat! no more?â)  He believed
    that Â£1,600 would cover the whole expense, to meet which they had
    already received by benefaction (including Â£200 from the Norwich
    Musical Festival) upwards of Â£600, while upwards of Â£1,000 had been
    raised among the shareholders.  It would be highly desirable to pay
    off the shareholders as the funds would allow, and to keep up the
    annual subscriptions.  At present they were adequate to the annual
    expenditure, but he trusted the inhabitants would do their utmost to
    increase the annual income.  This was the only charitable institution
    founded on the day of her Majestyâs Coronation, and he was induced to
    hope that an application to Her Majestyâs advisers would obtain a
    benefaction from her privy purse.  He was sanguine in his
    anticipation that in a short time the shares would be reduced to one
    for each shareholder, which it was thought desirable should remain.

    F. R. Reynolds, Esq., thought the reduction would be made in less
    than seven years.

    The Rev. M. Waters said that, allowing them to remain in their
    present position, the new institution would not be more rent than the
    present Hospital in Queen Street.

    Mr. Steward then submitted a resolution, that all monies arising from
    benefactions or otherwise, except from annual subscriptions, be
    applied in paying the shareholders till such shareholders should have
    but one share each; and that the annual subscriptions should be kept
    as a distinct fund.

    This resolution was moved by H. V. Worship, Esq., and seconded by C.
    J. Palmer, Esq., and carried unanimously.

    The Secretary observed that the balance of subscriptions would be
    less at the end of the present year than it was at the end of the
    preceding one, and this he mentioned that the public might know it
    would depend on themselves whether so excellent an institution should
    continue as efficient as it had hitherto been.

    It was stated that the number of out-patients had never been less
    than 100 throughout the past half-year.

                     THE FUNERAL OF CAPTAIN HARMER, R.N.

    The following particulars, relative to the interment of this much
    lamented officer (who died while in command of Her Majestyâs steam
    frigate âDriver,â in China), will, (the Editor thinks), no doubt, be
    read with much interest:â

                                        H.M.S. âThalia,â at Chusan, China,
                                                         17th April, 1843.

    As I have arranged, with the kind concurrence of Major General Sir
    James Schoedde, that the interment of the late lamented Capt. Harmer,
    of Her Majestyâs steam frigate âDriver,â shall take place to-morrow
    forenoon at ten oâclock; it is my direction that the officers,
    seamen, and marines mentioned underneath, be sent in boats also
    stated against each shipâs name, so as to assemble round the âDriverâ
    at half-past nine oâclock.  The procession of boats will leave the
    âDriverâ precisely at ten oâclock and proceed to the West pier,
    abreast that vessel, when it will be met by the Major General and all
    the officers of the garrison and a detachment of 100 rank and file of
    Her Majestyâs 95th Regiment, as that gallant officer has, in the most
    handsome and kind manner, expressed an anxious wish to pay every
    possible mark of respect to the remains of the much regretted Capt.
    Harmer.  As many of the officers of the army lost their full dress
    coats during the late war in this country, I have arranged with
    General Sir James Schoedde, in order that both services may appear
    alike, that all the officers of the navy and marines appear in
    undress coats, epaulettes, cocked hats and swords, with crape on the
    left arm above the elbow, if it can be procured in time.  The marines
    will be in full dress, but without chakos, and will be provided with
    three rounds of blank cartridges for every man.  The seamen are to be
    in blue jackets and trousers, white frocks and black hats.  All the
    arrangements on the part of the army are to be conducted by Major
    OâLeary, Brigade Major of Chusan; on the part of the navy, Capt.
    Quin, of H.M.S. âMinden.â

The pall bearers are to be three Field Officers of the army, and the
Commanders of the âPelican,â âSerpent,â and âPylades.â  Lieut. Kisbee, of
the âDriver,â will be chief mourner, supported by the Officers of that
vessel.

H.M.S. âThalia.ââFour boats, three lieutenants, purser, naval instructor,
two medical officers, one midshipman, three volunteers (1st class.)

H.M.S. âMinden.ââThree boats, two lieutenants, master, purser, two
medical officers, two volunteers (1st class), one sergeant and ten
marines.

H.M.S. âPelicanââTwo boats, two lieutenants, one medical officer, purser,
one mate, one midshipman one volunteer (1st class), one sergeant, and
fifteen marines.

H.M.S. âSerpentâ and âPylades.ââSame as âPelicanâ in every respect as to
boats and marines, and as nearly as possible with regard to officers.

All the officers and crew of the âDriverâ will attend, excepting those
left on board to take care of the vessel.  The above number of boats is
exclusive of those the Captains and Commanders will be in.

The colours of all the squadron will be hoisted half-mast high at eight
oâclock, and remain so till sunset.

                                                                   Signed,
                                                               CHAS. HOPE,

                    Captain of H.M.S. âThalia,â and senior officer Chusan.

P.S.âThe boats will be provided with ensigns and pendants, but only the
former will be half-mast high.

Capt. Harmer was buried under the fort, surrounded by hundreds of his
brethren in arms, who were either killed at the last capture of Chusan or
who died from the effects of the climate.  The officers of the âDriver,â
much to their credit, and evincing a proper respect for a much-loved
commander, have erected a neat monument over his remains at their own
expense.  So highly was he esteemed, even by the Chinese, that numbers of
the respectable men of the city also attended.

The merchant ships, following the example of the squadron, kept their
colours half-mast high until sunset.

Of Capt. Harmer it might well be said, in the language of the order,
âthat he paid proper respect to those who were destined to rule over him;
that he worked diligently, lived creditably, and acted honourably by all
men.â  Brother, farewell.

Dec. 2nd.âMr. John B. Bales had been presented with a splendid tea

November 9th contains the following legal report:â

    The Queen v. Chas. Cory Aldred.âApplication for a criminal
    information.âMr. Martin applied in this case on behalf of Mr. Marsh,
    the Mayor of Yarmouth, for a rule for a criminal information against
    the defendant.  Mr. Marsh stated in his affidavit that he was Mayor
    of Yarmouth, and a Magistrate of the Borough, and that on the 10th of
    June last he attended at his office for the purpose of transacting
    magisterial business, upon which occasion a person was charged with
    ringing the bell of Mr. Aldred during divine service, and a constable
    produced a paper without any direction or signature relative to the
    offence with which the person was charged.  The Mayor and the
    Magistrate who was with him were of opinion that they could not
    receive such a paper, and that Mr. Aldred ought to attend himself.
    The paper was returned to the constable with injunctions to tell Mr.
    Aldred that he must attend himself if he wished to take proceedings
    against the party.  This took place on the 10th of June.  On the 12th
    of June, Mr. Marsh was going along King-street, when defendant came
    up to him, seized him by the arm, and making use of some very
    offensive expressions, demanded an explanation for the impertinent
    manner in which the Mayor had treated his letter.  The Mayor replied
    that he was the Chief Magistrate of the town, that his hands were
    therefore tied up, and that he could not enter into any explanation
    then.  Mr. Aldred then reiterated the expressions, and followed Mr.
    Marsh up the street, still repeating them all the time.  Mr. Marsh
    after this sent two persons to Mr. Aldred, requesting him to consider
    what he had done, and whether he would not attend to make some
    apology for his conduct.  Mr. Aldred did attend, but instead of
    making an apology he repeated the observations again in a manner most
    offensive to the Mayor.  After the first offence, the Mayor thought
    to take proceedings against the defendant for sureties to keep the
    peace, but considered that the repetition of such conduct in an open
    Court was such an aggravation of the original offence, that he felt
    it due to his office and himself to take other proceedings.  One of
    the Magistrates insisted on taking sureties, which he did two or
    three days afterwards.  But he (Mr. Martin) apprehended that the
    circumstances of this case were such as not to deprive Mr. Marsh on
    that account of coming to this Court.

    Mr. Justice PattesonâYou do not put this as being a provocation to a
    breach of the peace?

    Mr. MartinâIt was an actual breach of the peace, for an assault was
    committed.

    Mr. Justice PattesonâThat was in the first instance.  There was
    nothing but words in the second instance, but the Magistrate was
    acting at the time in his magisterial capacity.

    Mr. MartinâIt was so; and they thought it also right to have an
    affidavit from the Police-constable, who stated in his affidavit that
    he merely delivered the paper without any offensive expression
    whatever, and the answer he received was âD---n the Mayor and
    Magistrates; what do I care for them?âRule _nisi_ granted.â

  The Queen on the prosecution of Samuel Charles Marsh, Esq., v. Charles
                               Cory Aldred.

Mr. MartinâMy Lord, in the case of the Queen v. Aldred, my learned
friend, Mr. Robinson, will address your Lordship.

Mr. RobinsonâIn this case, my Lord, Mr. Aldred has been indicted for
having spoken certain words of the prosecutor; he has pleaded not guilty.
This gentleman, I have to state, used the words under some mistake, and
he is now anxious to withdraw his plea of not guilty, and to express his
regret for having used the words of which the prosecutor has complained.
I have now, therefore, to withdraw the plea of not guilty and to enter a
plea of guilty.

Mr. MartinâMy Lord, I appear on behalf of the prosecutor, the Mayor of
Yarmouth, who felt himself compelled to bring the matter before the
Court.  He has no personal feeling in the matter, and is perfectly
satisfied with the expression of regret made by my learned friend, and
upon payment of the costs by the defendant, if your Lordship pleases, he
will not proceed further.

Mr. Justice ColeridgeâVery well.â

Yarham (who figured in the Chandler murder case) had âat length been
compelled, by the expression of public feeling, to quit the town.â

May 3rd.âOnly one tender had been sent in for the New Haven Bridge, and
it was considered probable that the plans for it would be amended.

May 10th.âReports the âFall of the Yarmouth Suspension Bridge,â (with a
wood-cut of the wreck of that structure), which had happened on Friday,
the 2nd inst.  The following is extracted from such report:â

    On the afternoon of the day on which this narration bears date,
    Nelson, the Clown at Mr. Cookeâs Circus, had undertaken to swim in a
    tub, drawn by four geese, from the drawbridge on the Quay to the
    Suspension Bridge across the North riverâa foolish exhibitionâbut it
    was one which, from its novelty in Yarmouth, was calculated to
    attract the multitude.  As early as five oâclock, when the train
    arrived from Norwich, although raining smartly, thousands of
    spectators had already assembled to witness the feat on both sides of
    the river.  The Bridge was then comparatively clear.  The Clown
    commenced his feat with the flood tide at the drawbridge, and had
    entered the North river.  There were many persons on the Bridge, and
    as he drew near, the multitude upon it endeavoured to obtain a full
    view as he should pass underneath.  Already had he reached Besseyâs
    Wharf, not far from the Bridge, when one or two of the rods were
    observed to give way; an instant alarm was given to quit the bridge.
    Alas! the caution came too late.  The chains broke, and quick as the
    passing thought, one entire side fell, and the whole mass of the
    human beings, whose numbers were estimated from three to four
    hundred, were swept into the river below.  The traffic road of the
    Bridge, which but an instant before was horizontal, had become nearly
    perpendicular.

    The children, poor little things, of whom there were very many, and
    had naturally gathered to the balustrade, were of course the first to
    sink, while the force with which the whole fell, caused those who
    were in the background to be hurled with terrific force into the
    water beneath, crushing and annihilating those under them.

    Oh! who shall paint the one mighty simultaneous agonizing
    death-scream which burst upon the affrighted multitude
    aroundâre-echoing from earth to heavenâmay the appeal not be made in
    vain.  One instant and all was hushed, save the struggling of a few
    whose lives it pleased their Maker in his mercy to spare.  The
    waters, we are told, as if gifted with a sudden impulse of horror, at
    this fell swoop of death, recoiled in the impetus of the fall and
    âboiled upâ at the back of the Bridge, which hung perpendicularly
    below the surface of the river.  As suddenly the struggle for life
    was past to all but a few.

    Then came a scene scarcely less heartrending.  With an energy,
    activity, and stern determination of purpose, which are among the
    wise and merciful provisions of the Almighty, twenty-seven children,
    all girls, were immediately rescued alive on the West side of the
    river, and as instantly put to bed at the âVauxhall Gardens,â who as
    soon as revived were replaced by others equally beneficially spared,
    or by some never to be recalled.  Some scrambled out and rushed home
    to their own houses, not a few fainting after arriving safe at home.
    On the East side numbers of bodies were taken into the adjoining
    houses, where all the assistance which medical skill, humane
    attention, in short all the aid which humanity would teach everyone
    to offer, was brought to bear.  Alas how often in vain.  In one house
    alone, at nine oâclock at night, out of sixty-eight bodies carried in
    only three were revived.

    Many a touching scene was witnessed as the anxious mother, and the
    hardly less excited father or friend, recognised some missing one
    safely emerging from the crowd.  Thousands thronged the North
    Quayâmessengers were despatched in all directions to procure medical
    aid, and the communication with the West side of the water being cut
    off, hundreds were left in painful suspense respecting those who were
    safe on the opposite shore.  Nothing could exceed the promptitude,
    activity, and attention of the surgeons and medical men of the town,
    all of whom were in immediate attendance doing all they could to
    afford relief to the sufferers, where the slightest chance of
    resuscitation appeared.  Mr. Lacon and a number of the persons
    employed in his brewery were exceedingly active in supplying hot
    water for baths, which is not far distant.  All the blankets from the
    Union House that could possibly be spared were in requisition.

    The scene now presented is still most agonising.  Children, mothers,
    and fathers, seeking one or other of their families, tracing and
    discovering in the pale face of some of the dead, one of their
    dearest ties.  In every street are to be seen one or more bodies
    extended on biers, returning to that home from which but short
    minutes before they had passed in health and life.  The
    consternationâthe agony of the town is not to be describedâit is as
    if some dread punishment was felt to have fallen upon its
    inhabitantsâevery face is horror-strickenâevery eye is dim.

    Never since the devastating plague in 1664, which swept off 2000 of
    its inhabitants, has Yarmouth, notwithstanding its numberless
    shipwrecks, been visited with so dire a calamity, occurring too at
    the very moment a public meeting was about to be held to make
    arrangements for the distribution of the funds which have been
    received for the widows and families of the Beachmen who were lost in
    January last.  How many are there added to this list?  We dare not
    anticipateâTime will show.

    Numbers, it is believed, are entangled with the rods and other
    portions of the broken Bridge.  At this hour it is impossible to say
    how many or who are called to their dread accounts.  The escape of
    some was miraculous.  One woman, of the name of Gillings, the wife of
    a carpenter, was on the Bridge with her child; when she was hurled
    into the water, with extraordinary presence of mind she seized her
    childâs clothes with her teethâthus preventing the rush of water, and
    paddled herself to a place of safety.

    On the East side of the Bridge the greater number were taken to the
    âNorwich Arms Inn,â where there were at one time fifty-three corpses.
    Others were taken to the âAdmiral Collingwoodâ and to the âSwan,â and
    many to their own houses.  Not a few of those who first got out of
    the water went away unnoticed, and their number is unknown.  Up to a
    late hour last night, it was ascertained that seventy-five dead
    bodies had been taken out of the water; and up to midnight, from the
    enquiries made, it was ascertained that forty-five others were
    missing.

    By far the greater number of those lost were females and children.
    James Marshall, 16, escaped with a wound in the scalp.  Two boys
    named Honorley, aged twelve and seventeen, were taken home, the
    younger died last evening, the elder is likely to recover.

    The inquest on the bodies of the drowned was held next day at the
    âChurch Hall,â before W. S. Ferrier, Esq., coroner, when the
    following gentlemen were sworn on the Jury:âSamuel Palmer, Esq.,
    (foreman), and Messrs. John Norman, John Orfeur, John Fenn, G. B.
    Palmer, William Smith, William Spillings, Charles Barber, Charles
    Woolverton, Joseph Davy, James Emms, William Haylett, Mark Blowers,
    J. E. Laws, John Stagg, E. Garrod, Thomas Davy, and James Pratt, and
    after hearing evidence as to the identification of the bodies of the
    drowned was adjourned _sine die_.  The following list of the victims
    is given:â

Esq.

And Mr. T. Hammond and J. Jackson proposed and seconded, Robert John
Bagshaw, Esq.

The following statements of the poll were issued during the contest:â(The
small number of votes recorded was consequent on the disfranchisement of
the freemen, and the election taking place before those freemen who were
entitled to do so, could qualify as Householders.)

               Sandars.       Rumbold.       Bagshaw.
10 a.m.             121            134            156
12Â½ p.m.            292            279            244

After the declaration of the poll only Mr. Sandarsâ friends made any
preparation for the chairing.  âNot a bit of blue ribbon was seen, and
Mr. Rumboldâs friend seemed all to have been dyed deep red.â

Mr. Bagshaw addressed the electors from the âStar Hotel,â when Mr. J. W.
Shelly made some strong observations on the conduct of Mr. Rumboldâs
friends in supporting Mr. Sandars jointly with that gentleman, which
appear to have caused a great deal of âheart burningâ in the borough and
this especially so with regard to a combination known as the âStar
clique.â

July 22nd.âMr. Edward Sewell (a quaker) who had been denounced by Mr.
Shelly for voting for Sandars and Rumbold, vindicated his conduct in this

The âDaringâ and âSecretâ withdrew under protest that the âMosquitoâ did
not start from her moorings.  This she had done, but the hour for
starting having been delayed she was obliged to remove.  At ten seconds
past one oâclock they all started with a stiff breeze from the S.W.  The
âMosquitoâ took the lead after rounding the first buoy, and maintained it

    the Theatre about ten minutes before eleven; her sister, Miss E.
    Sayers, went home in a sedan chair and deceased walked.  The night
    was extremely dark and rainy, but no gas lamps were lighted.  Captain
    Pearson and his family were spending the evening out, and on
    returning at about half-past eleven, found Miss E. Sayers in some
    anxiety that her sister was so long in following her.  Captain
    Pearson immediately went to the police office to procure assistance
    in searching for her, for which purpose Police-constable Page took a
    lantern.  About half-past three in the morning he dragged the river
    opposite the Town Hall, and there found the body.  The watch of

    âWhen found, make a note ofââ

                                                             CAPT. CUTTLE.



1851.


Jan. 4th.âAt the meeting of the Town Council, the Councillors for the St.
Georgeâs, Market and Gorleston Wards refused to appoint Ward Aldermen âas
they had no confidenceâ in the Aldermen recently appointed by the casting
vote of the Mayor.

The âWater questionâ was before the public, when, as to the Ormesby water
with which it was proposed to supply the town, Mr. Cooper, an eminent
analytical chemist, stated that such water âwas turbid from the green and
brown matter in itâ and that âthe large quantity (four grains) of
vegetable organic matter that it contained rendered it wholly unfit for
domestic purposes other than cleansing.â

Jan. 11th.âChas. J. Palmer had presided at the Annual Public Library
meeting, when it was stated that upwards of 5,000 books belonged to that
institution.

lighting the Denes.

Wm. Sumner, an ex-constable was bound over to keep the peace at the
instance of Samuel Tolver, Esq.

Feb. 1st.âThe following notice appears as to No. 4, South Quay:â

    A tradition has long existed in connection with the Elizabethian
    House upon the Quay, formerly belonging to John Carter, the regicide,
    but now the residence of C. J. Palmer, Esq., F.S.A., (mentioned by
    Noble, vol. 2, p. 340), that of the âmany secret consultsâ which the
    rebels held prior to the trial and execution of King Charles I. the
    fatal and final one took place in a chamber in the above mentioned
    house, in which Carter then lived.  A meeting of the chief
    Parliamentarian Generals was summoned, and the regicides, it is said,
    met early in the afternoon, and the conference, which was one of
    âgreat secrecy,â did not terminate until near the hour of midnight,
    the dinner which had been ordered for four oâclock not being served
    until the meeting broke up.  This tradition, though generally
    credited, had hitherto received no confirmation to render it of
    historical value.  The important fact has, however, been placed
    almost beyond a doubt, as we can state on the authority of F.
    Worship, Esq., that in the course of the labours of the Committee
    recently appointed by the Town Council to inquire into the ancient
    records and muniments of the Borough, a record has been found of the
    visit of Oliver Cromwell to our town about the time alluded to, it
    having never yet been definitely ascertained that the Protector
    visited Yarmouth.  We hope this very interesting discovery will
    induce the Committee to prosecute their labours, and when the
    valuable town documents have been arranged and restored, the Council
    will see the propriety and necessity of providing some suitable
    depository for them.

Feb. 8th.âThe New Mercantile Marine Act had excited much dissatisfaction,
and several handbills had appeared urging the sailors to take action, and
on Tuesday morning having âstruck,â they mustered in groups on the
Hall-quay.  Subsequently they formed in procession to the number of 1,000
and paraded the town for several hours; they had a band and flags with
them, and a board on which was written âDo not sign the lawsâ and âWages
Â£2 15s.  Summer and Winter.â

A Seamanâs Union had been formed having 450 members, and Mr. J. Teasdel
having given notice that he did not intend to reduce the wages paid to
his men to 50s. a month, several hundred of the men on strike, went over
the Bridge and manned the yards of a vessel belonging to that gentleman,
for whom they gave some loud and hearty cheers.

The Magistrates refused to sign a 1s. 9d.  Poor rate, but such rate was
subsequently signed by Mr. W. H. Palmer and Mr. J. Fenn and the rate for
that amount made.

Feb. 15th.âA meeting of the shipowners had been held at the Town-hall to
consider the seamenâs grievances, the Mayor in the chair, when upon the
motion of Mr. George Danby-Palmer, a resolution was carried to obtain a
repeal of the act of Parliament complained of, and a Committee formed
consisting of six owners and six seamen with the Mayor as chairman to
give effect to such resolution; the wages question was, however, not
discussed.

Feb. 22nd.âA further meeting had been held âto take into consideration
the present complaint of seamen respecting their wages, that the same may
be equalized throughout the year whether by voyage or month.â

About 30 owners were present, and also the Sailorsâ Committee; the Mayor
was in the chair, and the sailors refused to be bound by their âold
agreement;â the following account is given of their subsequent
proceedings:â

    Since the above meeting a letter has been sent to the Mayor,
    announcing that the sailors were determined not to abide for the
    future by the old agreement; and handbills were also publicly issued,
    announcing a âgrand processionâ of the seamen of the port for the
    following day.  Accordingly on Saturday the sailors assembled
    opposite to their rendezvous, at the Royal Exchange on the Quay, to
    the number of about 1,500, and flags, union jacks, &c., with a band
    of music having been procured, a procession was formed, which paraded
    the town for several hours.  The men were mostly respectably attired,
    and wore rosettes of various colours, from which were suspended the
    medals of the Shipwrecked Marinersâ Society.  Some of the men were
    dressed in various emblematical characters, such as Britannia,
    Neptune, Amphitrite, Triton, &c., and were borne upon the shoulders
    of the crowd in boats, dolphin cars, &c., which were decorated with
    evergreens, &c., in short the whole assemblage seemed more like a
    triumphal procession than that of a demonstration occasioned by one
    of those unfortunate breaches between employers and employed, termed
    a âstrike.â  Throughout the crowd a number of placards were
    distributed, bearing the following inscription:ââWe, the seamen of
    Yarmouth, hereby testify our gratitude to the inhabitants, for the
    handsome manner in which they have come forward to assist us in
    obtaining our just rights.â  Also a number of poles, terminating in
    tridents, fishes, &c., were borne aloft, together with a handsomely
    carved model ship, covered with the flags of all nations.

Mr. S. S. Barber had applied to the Bench for the assistance of the civil
force to protect his seamen, who had just arrived by the âMaid of the
Yare,â London Trader, and who had been persuaded to leave their vessel,
and even threatened to be taken away by force if they did not leave.  The
Superintendent and some of the police went down to the spot, but, as the
men remained perfectly peaceable, their presence was not at all required.

The following members of the Council had addressed a letter to the
Treasury protesting against a proposed loan for drainage purposes, which
was said to have been carried by a majority of the Council at its last
meeting:âSir E. H. K. Lacon, R. Ferrier, E. H. L. Preston, F. Worship,
William H. Palmer, R. Steward, R. D. Barber, E. R. Aldred, J. C. Smith,
J. G. Plummer, J. Cherry, J. E. Barnby, C. C. Aldred, B. Jay, R. Ferrier,
junr., S. Miller and William Worship, and thereupon at the Council
meeting a very warm discussion ensued, during which Mr. C. C. Aldred was
accused of having called Mr. George Danby-Palmer âa liar,â and Sir E. H.
K. Lacon (by Mr. Henry Danby-Palmer) of having made a disturbance by
âkicking against the panels.â

March 1st.âThe following Councillors subsequently addressed a letter to
the Treasury in respect of these proceedings:âD. A. Gourlay, H.
Danby-Palmer, J. Bayly, R. Hammond, J. Lettis, junr., J. Fish, W. T.
Clarke, J. Barker, P. Pullyn, J. Jackson, J. D. Chapman, R. Hammond,
junr., G. Danby-Palmer, W. N. Burroughs, C. E. Bartram, M. Butcher, J. G.
Cannell, H. Boulter, P. White, J. Fiddes and J. Pike.

This issue contains the following report of the Sailorsâ Strike and
Riot:â

    We have this week to record a riot of a serious nature arising out of
    the unfortunate strike among the seamen who, until recently, had
    conducted themselves in a manner highly creditable to so large a body
    of men placed in such circumstances.  Since the ill-advised
    rejection, by the men, of the old agreement as to wages, there have
    been several mariners (as there always must be with an over-stocked
    labour market) quite ready and glad to sail at different rates to
    those proposed by those who struck; and forseeing that if such
    defections from their camp continued, their strike would be
    unavailing, the sailors have during the last week been in the habit
    of parading the Quay, in gangs, for the purpose of unlawfully
    preventing such as were willing to go to sea from joining their
    ships, and partly by force, and partly by threats, several men have
    been deterred from fulfilling their engagements.  Although these
    facts were known to the authorities, no steps were taken to put a
    stop to them, in the hope that the reasonable and peaceable portion
    of the sailors would see how unjustifiable was the course they were
    pursuing, and how really destructive it was to the interests both of
    the owners and men.  The same line of conduct was, however,
    continued.  The first case brought before the Bench was that of
    Samuel Graystone, the mate of the schooner âAnt,â belonging to Mr. S.
    S. Barber, who applied for the protection of the police, the men
    having been taken out of his vessel on Friday afternoon last.  On
    Saturday morning, Mr. Barber again appeared before the Mayor to
    complain that the master and crew of the âMaid of the Yareâ had been
    interrupted, and made to go on shore.  The master having come up and
    corroborated this statement, the crew were sent for and asked if they
    were willing to go to sea, having signed articles.  The master and
    mate said they were, but the men declined, through fear of personal
    violence.  They were told that if they did not they must be sent to
    gaol, but if they were willing to go they should be protected.  They
    then agreed to go, and were sent down accordingly with a body of the
    police; the master and mate went on board, but the crew refused, and
    the police were therefore withdrawn, when some sailors went and
    ill-used the mate, throwing him over the bows of his ship on to the
    Quay Head.  The captain also was pushed on shore.  Subsequently the
    Bench were informed that the man Graystone had again been taken out
    of his vessel, which had gone to sea without him, and was then lying
    in Corton Roads.  Graystone was sent for, and said he was not willing
    to go; but on an information being taken against him for refusing, he
    said he would if he could be protected.  A steamtug was therefore
    ordered to convey him to his vessel, and on its arriving opposite the
    Town Hall at half-past two oâclock, the Magistrates agreed, before
    taking any other steps, to try whether the police were not sufficient
    to protect the men on board, notwithstanding the evident
    determination of a large body of sailors to prevent him.  The
    Superintendent of Police, therefore, arranged the whole force, and
    with Graystone in the centre, surrounded by the Mayor and
    Magistrates, the escort left the station-house, distant not more than
    one hundred yards from the steamtug.  When about half way down, the
    crowd, which then consisted of about 200 or 300 sailors, set up a
    tremendous yell and rushed upon the police, whose ranks were speedily
    broken, several of the police and Magistrates being struck.  They
    rallied, and with the assistance of the Magistrates, who were mainly
    instrumental in preventing Graystone from being rescued, they
    succeeded in placing him safely on board the tug.  The principal
    ringleaders were then picked out, and after some considerable
    struggling they were got into the station-house.  By this time the
    concourse of people had increased to upwards of a thousand.  Some of
    the men then obtained a spar or boom which was brought opposite the
    station-house door for the purpose of using it as a battering ram to
    release the six or seven prisoners within.  Several stones were
    thrown, and a few windows broken; upon which the Mayor immediately
    swore in as many persons as were willing to be special constables,
    and a sally was made upon the mob, and with considerable difficulty
    the spar was got away, and one or two of those who were using it were
    taken into custody, but being completely overpowered, the authorities
    were compelled to retreat with the force into the station-house.
    Shortly after, Capt. Ellis, R.N., having arrived with a body of the
    coastguardsmen, armed with muskets, &c., together with some of the
    men from the revenue cutter, they took up a position in front of the
    Hall and Police-station.  The Mayor then read the Riot Act, the
    people not dispersing, but on the contrary rather increasing, as
    there must then have been several thousands.  Mr. G. D. Palmer
    addressed a few words to them from the Hall-door, imploring them to
    desist from the foolish course they had taken, and entreating them to
    disperse peaceably.  A stone was then hurled at the spot where the
    Magistrates were standing, but it fortunately did not take effect,
    and the man who threw it was instantly secured and brought into the
    station-house.  The following proclamation was issued by the Mayor:â

                 âBorough of Great Yarmouth, 22nd Feb., 1851.

    âNOTICE.âA riot having this day taken place in this Borough, and the
    Riot Act having been read, all peaceable and loyal inhabitants are
    desired to keep in their houses until order has been restored.  And
    notice is hereby further given, that no assemblage of persons will be
    allowed.

                                                  CHARLES PEARSON, Mayor.â

    After a consultation of the Magistrates, they unanimously determined
    to send to Norwich for a troop of the Military stationed there.  A
    telegraphic message was therefore despatched, which reached the
    Norwich Station about half-past four oâclock.  In the meantime nine
    of the East Norfolk Militia located here, under Captain Brown,
    arrived, and were speedily followed by detachments of the Coastguard
    from the stations at Caister, Winterton, Corton, &c., who were all
    sworn in as special constables.  The total available force for the
    protection of the town now amounted to 201, viz., 90 special
    constables, 81 officers and men of the revenue cutter and coastguard,
    21 policemen, and 9 militia men; and it was determined to clear the
    space in front of the station-house, which, with much difficulty was
    accomplished, when the police succeeded in picking out and taking
    several of the ringleaders.

    Some persons consider that the people might have been entirely
    dispersed without the aid of the military, but considering the
    overwhelming number of persons present, it could only have been
    accomplished by the armed force charging among the people, which
    might have involved much bloodshed, if not actual loss of life, and
    there can be no doubt that the authorities exercised a wise and
    prudent discretion in contenting themselves by keeping the crowd as
    it were at bay, until the arrival of the military, a troop of which,
    consisting of 35 of the 11th Hussars, under Captain Douglas, reached
    the Yarmouth station by special train at about a quarter to six in
    the evening.  A great mob of people had assembled at the terminus,
    and the officer in command refused to enter the town unless
    accompanied by a magistrate on horseback.  J. C. Smith, Esq.,
    accordingly having gone down, the troop, a little before seven
    oâclock, entered the town and cantering their horses over the quay
    and pavements, the crowd which had remained in front of the
    Police-court fled in every direction, some of them in their anxiety
    to escape the too near approach of the soldiersâ swords, actually
    running over one another.  Several women were knocked down by the mob
    in their flight, but we believe no injuries, beyond a few broken
    heads and bruised limbs, were received by any one.  Great numbers of
    persons, however, secreted themselves by the river side, and in the
    ends of the numerous narrow rows in the town, under the impression
    that the military could not dislodge them.  The Mayor, however,
    having issued orders for the entire quay to be cleared, the police,
    aided by a strong body of special constables, were for some hours
    engaged in dispersing the knots of people who had collected in these
    localities; patrols of the military and the police were then placed
    at all the principal thoroughfares leading to the Town Hall, which
    had been the scene of the riot, for the purpose of stopping all
    persons from coming that way.  About eleven oâclock order having
    been, comparatively speaking, restored, the Magistrates consulted
    with the commanding-officer, and it was agreed that the military
    (which now numbered 75 in all, having been joined by another troop)
    should retire to their quarters, holding themselves in readiness to
    be called out at a minuteâs warning.  The police were sent on their
    regular beats, but the cutterâs men and coastguardsmen remained at
    the Hall during the whole of the Saturday night, as did also the
    special constables, who were divided into three divisions, under
    regular captains, for the purpose of relieving each other every four
    hours.  At half-past nine on Sunday morning, the Mayor and
    Magistrates again assembled, but as everything had passed off quietly
    during the night, and as there did not seem any disposition on the
    part of the persons who were collected round the Hall (more by
    curiosity than otherwise) to commit any breach of the peace, the
    special constables, with most of the coastguardsmen were released
    from further duty until they should be again summoned, if required,
    by the alarm bell.  At the close of the morningâs service the
    Magistrates held a further consultation, when it was determined to
    draw up a report of the occurrences which had taken place, and to
    transmit the same to Sir G. Grey, the Secretary of the Home
    Department, to whom it was suggested that it would be advisable that
    a war steamer should be sent down to the port until order was
    entirely restored.

    We cannot conclude our report without bearing our testimony to the
    great and extraordinary exertions to maintain peace and order made by
    our excellent Chief Magistrate, ably supported as he was by everyone
    of his brother Magistrates, and to the firmness and determination
    displayed by the Authorities may be mainly attributed to the
    preservation of the public peace, and the prompt and effectual
    suppression of the riotious spirit displayed by some thoughtless and
    illadvised men.  It could hardly have been supposed that any friends
    of order could have been found ready to cast any blame upon the
    Authorities for the wise precautions they took, but we regret to say
    that some persons who, instead of coming forward to assist in
    preserving the public peace, kept, to their shame, in their own
    houses, and who, entirely ignorant of the organisation which was on
    foot, presume to censure those whom they should have been the first
    to support.  Such parties are, however, we trust, but few, for we
    feel sure that the course pursued on the present occasion by the
    Authorities, will receive the unqualified approval and sanction of
    all the peaceably disposed and loyal inhabitants of the town.  The
    conduct of the Police forceâas well as that of the special
    constablesâwas most meritorious and praiseworthy; some of the former
    especially distinguished themselves for their courageous conduct, but
    it would be invidious to make any distinction between them, as all
    the men in the force are equally deserving of praise.  They exercised
    the greatest forbearance, being most grossly insulted and ill-used,
    notwithstanding which they abstained from using their staves until
    the spirit of riot being openly manifested, they were directed to use
    them by their excellent superintendent, Capt. B. Love.
    Police-constable Fuller has been very seriously injured, it being
    feared that some of his ribs are broken; another man who was engaged
    in the cowardly act of beating Police-constable Johnson while on the
    ground, in his turn received a blow from the truncheon of one of the
    special constables, which inflicted a very serious wound on his head.
    Many other persons were hurt in the course of the riot, but not that
    we can learn to any serious extent.  It is said, however, that a man
    was severely wounded in the hand by the sword of one of the soldiers,
    he having seized the bridle and nearly thrown the latter.

On the succeeding Monday the several cases were dealt with arising out of
these proceedings.

Mr. I. Preston appeared to prosecute, Mr. C. Cooper (instructed by Mr. F.
S. Costerton) representing the prisoners.

Robert Watson (for obstructing Captain Love, Surperintendent of Police)
fined 10s.

James King (for threatening E. H. L. Preston, Esq.,) fined 40s.

Samuel Bowles (like offence) fined Â£3.

John Crow (ditto) fined Â£1.

James Harvey, William Balls and William Stoddard (ditto) discharged with
a caution.

Samuel Gowing (ditto) fined Â£1.

Henry Walpole (charged by William Danby-Palmer, Esq., with a like
offence) fined Â£2.

James Vincent (for creating a disturbance) fined 10s.

George Walton (charged by Mr. S. S. Barber) for a ârescue,â fined Â£5.

Alfred Pye (for assaulting Police-constable Lattimore) fined Â£2.

William Bee, John Creak, Benjamin Mallett, Edward Brooks, and Robert
Willgrass (charged with having taken part in the riot and disturbance)
were committed for trial, but Bee, Mallett and Creak were admitted to

each.

H.M. ships âBlack Eagleâ and âLightningâ had entered the Harbour and laid
on the west side of the river.

The Workhouse (which unfortunately contained a large number of idle and
dissolute characters) had been the scene of frequent disturbances, and
police had been lodged there on that account.  During the riot an
outbreak, however, had taken place, and a ringleader named Charles
Girdlestone taken into custody; he was sentenced to 42 daysâ hard labour
for this offence, and would be sent for trial for a ferocious attack on
the police.  Three other paupers had been sent to the treadmill for 21
days each for refractory conduct.

March 8th.âAt the Quarter Sessions, (held before N. Palmer, Esq.), the
rioters, John Creak (24), Benjamin Mallett (34), John Brooks (19),
William Bee (26), and Robert Willgrass (â), were put upon their trial.

Mr. Hotson (with whom was Mr. Mills and Mr. Bulwer) prosecuted, and Mr.
Evans (with whom was Mr. C. Cooper) defended the prisoners, the Jury
(having deliberated for 25 minutes) returned a verdict of Not Guilty,
âwhich verdict was received with a loud burst of applause, which lasted
two or three minutes.â

March 15th.âThe strike had ended, most of the owners having consented to
sign agreements for giving the men the wages they asked for, for a period
of 12 months.

March 22nd.âThe sailors had held a âGrand Procession with flags, banners,
and triumphant cars.â  In the latter were several men attired as Neptune,
Britannia, &c., in the evening they attended at the Vauxhall Gardens,
where there was a grand display of fireworks.âDuring the strike 500
stones of flour, 600 lbs. of beef, and 500 cwt. of coals, had been
distributed amongst the families of the men on strike from the
contributions of the inhabitants.

The N.A.O.D. had met at the Trinity Arms to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of the Trinity Lodge, No. 220.  Messrs. R. R. B. Norman, J.
P. Hastings, P.A., and F. Palmer took part in the proceedings.âIt was
stated there were then three lodges of this order in the town.

April 5th.âMr. Ferrier and Sir E. H. K. Lacon had appealed, without
success, against the rating of certain property on the Denes, on the
ground âthat it was not within the town.â

April 12th.âMr. S. Tolver had instructed Mr. Coppock, the parliamentary

Commissioners, and D. A. Gourlay and R. Hammond, Esqs., Supernumerary
Haven Commissioners.

April 19th.âMr. T. Brightwen was urging the appointment of a Chaplain at
the Workhouse.

The Conservatives had secured, for the first time, several scats at the
Board of Guardians, the following forming the new Board:â

Nominated by both partiesâMessrs. B. Fenn, S. C. Marsh, and S. V. Moore.

LiberalsâMessrs. G. Danby-Palmer, D. A Gourlay, and T. Brightwen.

ConservativesâMessrs. R. Ferrier, E. R. Aldred, C. Woolverton, W.
Worship, J. G. Plummer, W. Laws, E. H. L. Preston, S. Nightingale, J.
Cherry, and T. Paul.

Captain Ellis, R.N., had exhibited the model of a fast sailing yacht.

Captain James Day had been fined Â£5 for assaulting Mr. Nolloth, tailor.

The âPublic Heath Actâ was again being discussed by the Town Council,
where Mr. Burroughs moved, and Mr. Barker seconded, a petition against
the application of the Act to the Borough, and Mr. F. Worship moved, and
Mr. R. Ferrier, jun., seconded as an amendment that the Council pass to
the next business on the agenda paper.

Upon a division the amendment was lost by 15 to 23, and the original
motion declared to be carried by 23 to 17 votes.

April 26th.âAt a meeting held at the Angel-inn (C. J. Palmer, Esq., in
the chair) it was thought desirable âto advertise the town, and that a
saxhorn band should play daily on the principal promenades.â

May 10th.âThe pilots of Gorleston had succeeded in establishing a Tug
Company, and had purchased a boat of 45 horsepower, called âThe Royal
Albert.â

J. Hume, Esq., M.P., had introduced a deputation of Ratepayers opposed to
the âPublic Health Actâ to Lord Seymour (at the Woods and Forests
Office); it consisted of Charles Pearson, Esq., (Mayor); D. A. Gourlay,
Esq., (Deputy-Mayor); George Danby-Palmer, Esq., and William N.
Burroughs, Esq., with Mr. J. H. Harrison (Secretary), while 18 members of
the Council at the same time petitioned Parliament in favour of the
measure.

The sailors had held a meeting to consider the âTicketâ system and the
âMuster Rollâ fund.

May 17th.âIn consequence of the removal of the window tax, bricklayers
were busy throughout the town opening out windows formerly blocked up.

Mr. Cosgroveâs saxhorn band was to perform on the North and South
Terraces during the season.

The census head been taken with the following result:â

 Houses inhabited.      Uninhabited.       Total.        Building.
       5,984                344             6,328            78
     Families.             Males.         Females.         Total.
       6,154               11,544          15,014          26,558

Increase of population per cent., 10.3.  This included 347 inmates of the
Workhouse.

It was noted that in 1619 Manship estimated the then population of the
town at 1,200 households, which would give a population of some 7,000.

In 1724 a writer named Andrews stated the population at 13,000 or 14,000;
and in 1784 when it was first accurately taken, it was found to be
12,608.

The then returns were considered disappointing, as it was expected that
the town contained 30,000 persons, but it was noted that 2,500 sailors
belonged to the port, half of whom were probably not at home when the
return was made.

At this time Gorleston had a population of 2,586, and Southtown of 1,412
persons.

John Annison, the driver of the Sutton coach, had been convicted for the
fourth time of conveying passengers to Yarmouth at a greater speed than
four miles an hour without having a number plate on his vehicle, and
fined Â£10 with Â£3 3s. costs.

May 31st.âVisitors were beginning to arrive.

June 7th.âA project was on foot for laying out the Chapel Denes as an
ornamental walk for the public.

June 28th.âA mushroom measuring 29 inches in circumference, with a stalk
about the thickness of a manâs wrist and weighing 2Â½lbs., had been grown
at Bradwell.

James Gedge, a pauper lunatic, had escaped from the Workhouse, having
only a shirt on.

July 5th.âA Bill had been brought in by Lord Seymour and Mr. Cornewall
Lewis confirming the provisional order to applying the provisions of the
Board of Health Act to the town.

July 19th.âA petition, signed by 1,550 persons, had been presented to the
House, and a deputation had waited on Lord John Russell with regard to
this action of the Government.

The M.Pâs. for the town being in favour of the measure, âhad been
requested to resign the trust they had abused.â  This action emanated
from a public meeting of ratepayers, over which.  George Danby-Palmer,
Esq., presided, and at which Mr. S. W. Bly, Mr. A. Ames, Mr. W. N.
Burroughs, Mr. S. V. Moore, Mr. R. Hammond, and Mr. T. Parker took part.

July 26th.âThe Bill nevertheless passed through Committee by a majority
of 92 against 12.

Sir J. Walmsley had opposed and Lord Seymour supported the measure, but
eventually it passed the House of Commons without a division.

The paupers were much dissatisfied at not being allowed, as formerly, to
attend places of Worship in the town on Sundays.

Mr. C. Houchen had delivered an address on this subject, and denounced
the action of the Guardians.

Aug. 9th.âIt was computed that many hundreds of children in the North
District were entirely without the opportunity for instruction, and it
was proposed to fit up the Priory as a National School to meet this want.

Evidence had been taken by the Committee of the House of Lords upon the
Public Health Bill being applied to the town, and they reported the Bill
to the House without amendment; thus there was a âspeedy prospect of the
town being well drained and made clean and healthy in spite of its
one-idead rulers.â

Captain Smyth, R.N., had been raised to the rank of Post-Captain.

Six hundred and thirty electors had signed a requisition calling on
Messrs. Rumbold and Saunders to resign their seats as M.Pâs. for the
Borough.  This would form a majority of the voters.

The East Norfolk and Suffolk Horticultural Show had been held under the
patronage of the Mayoress, Lady Lacon, and Mr. S. C. J. Palmer.

Aug. 16th.âThe 279th, and last, meeting of the Paving Commissioners had
been held, when there were presentâMessrs. George Danby-Palmer (in the
chair), B. Dowson, W. N. Burroughs, J. Fish, C. E. Bartram, F. Palmer, J.
H. Harrison, S. V. Moore, P. White, J. Cobb, W. Crow, I. Lettis, jun.,
and W. H. Bessey.

Mr. Beechingâs newly-built lifeboat had been submitted to several tests
opposite the Crane.

Aug. 23rd.âMr. Beechingâs model had obtained the prize in the Lifeboat
Competition at Somerset House.  There were 280 models and plans sent in,
the first six boats beingâJames Beeching, Great Yarmouth; Henry Hinks,
Appledore; J. and E. Pellew, Newbury; William Teasdel, Great Yarmouth;
Harvey and Son, Ipswich, and George Farrow, South Shields.

Aug. 30th.âThe Licensed Victuallers had held a large and important
meeting for the purpose of protecting their interests, S. C. Marsh, Esq.,
in the chair.

Mr. G. Blyth (Reporter to the _Norfolk News_) had been induced to visit
at night a tower in the South-End of the town, belonging to George
Danby-Palmer, Esq., when he had been assaulted by some person there, and
of this he had complained to the Bench.

Sept. 13th.âThe Justices had refused to grant any fresh licenses at the
Brewster Sessions.

The âReindeerâ yawl (manned by Beachmen) had challenged the âAmericaâ
yacht to sail for Â£105.

Sept. 20th.âThe Council meeting had been broken up, leaving 20 subjects
undisposed of, owing to all the Conservatives and two or three of the
Liberal members leaving the meeting, which was thus reduced below the
required number to form a âquorum.â

Sept. 27th.âMr. Hilling had been appointed Town Surveyor at a salary of
Â£30 per annum, and Â£250 had been proposed as the salary of the
Town-Clerk, he also acting as Clerk to the newly-formed Local Board of
Health.  Mr. Clowes, however, declined to give his assent to serve on
these terms without further consideration.

Oct. 4th.âThere had been heavy gales and the Roadstead presented âa most
lamentable scene, crowded with shipping, which had put in for refuge to
the number of some hundreds.â

Two of the vessels belonging to the Franklin Exploration Expedition were
in the Roads.

Oct. 11th.âHarris Wilshak had been charged with being concerned in
smuggling 14lbs. of tobacco.

At the Revision Court Mr. F. S. Costerton appeared for the Liberals, and
Mr. C. Preston for the Tories.  Neither party claimed any gain from the
proceedings on the Parliamentary Lists, but on the Burgess Roll the
Liberals claimed a gain of 19, of which 15 were in the Regent-ward, where
a very warm contest was expected in November.

Oct. 18th.âMr. J. W. Crowe had been elected Surgeon to the Hospital
School.

The new Valuation Lists had increased the assessment of the parish by
Â£47,000.

Active preparations were being made for the Municipal contests.

Mr. Wilshak had been acquitted on the charge of smuggling.

George Deacon, known as âThe Prophet,â had thrown himself into the river,
as he stated that it was impossible that he should sink; he would have
been drowned but for the help of the bystanders.  When taken to the
Station House he was found to have Â£18, 2 old gold coins, and 21s. 6d.
upon him.

Oct. 25th.âThe Priory was being fitted for National Schools.

Houchen, who had been preaching against âthe powers that be,â had been
bound over to keep the peace in two sureties of Â£25 and himself in Â£50.

Nov. 8th.âThe Municipal Election had been hotly contested and the
partizans of the winning party (the Tories) made it âa boast of having
expended in the five wards a sum of money variously stated from Â£800 to
Â£1,200.â  The following was the return given with the poll of 1850
appended to it:â

            _North Ward_.
          1851â219 Voters.
Mr. S. Nightingale, C.            108
Mr. W. H. Bessey, C.              103
Mr. J. Mainprice, L.               97
Mr. H. D. Palmer, L.               95
          1850â208 Voters.
Mr. J. Jackson, L.                108
Mr. Burroughs, L.                 105
Mr. Nightingale, C.                90
Mr. Cory, C.                       68

In this Ward the Liberals headed the poll until nearly one oâclock, when
a detachment of Conservative ârunnersâ with some âdustâ turned the
election.  The price of votes was high, and ranged from Â£8 to Â£12; and it
is said that two polled for the winning party cost Â£20!

          _Market Ward_.
         1851â270 Voters.
Mr. J. E. Barnby, C.            148
Mr. J. Fenn, C.                 132
Mr. John Cobb, L.               120
         1850â261 Voters.
Mr. C. Aldred, C.               129
Mr. F. Worship, C.              123
Mr. Owles, L.                   104
Mr. J. S. Cobb, L.               84

In this Ward the Liberals did not bring forward two candidates, being
anxious to mark their approbation of Mr. Barnbyâs consistent opposition
to the Public Health Act; and here, as in the North Ward, their candidate
headed the poll until the arrival of the other portion of Conservative
workers from the Regent Ward, when a sufficient number of loose fish were
immediately polled to swamp the majority, at that time about twenty.  The
prices of votes ranged from five pounds to ten guineas at a late hour of
the day.

           _Regent Ward_.
          1851â244 Voters.
Sir E. H. K. Lacon, C.            115
Mr. J. Cherry, C.                 114
Mr. F. Palmer, L.                 101
Mr. J. Clowes, L.                  90
          1850â234 Voters.
Mr. Chapman, L.                   104
Mr. Marsh, C.                     104
Mr. Harmer, C.                     93
Mr. F. Palmer, L.                  84

Great exertions were used to secure the return of the out-going
Councillors, and it having been almost publicly stated that the
Conservatives were determined to win âat any cost,â votes, in
consequence, got up the night before the election to a very high
premiumâfrom Â£5 to Â£15; and âsplitâ votes even were in very great demand
at Â£8 and Â£10.  One case is mentioned of a voter, in another Ward, who,
forseeing the value which votes would attain, speculated in the purchase
of one in this a month before the election, at the trifling sum of Â£3,
and so profitable was the investment that on the election morning he sold
it for Â£10.  The money spent in this Ward was stated at Â£350.

         _St. Georgeâs Ward_.
           1851â256 Voters.
Mr. R. Ferrier, jun., C.            126
Mr. H. Jay, C.                      126
Mr. P. Pullyn, L.                    76
Mr. J. W. Shelly, L.                 66
           1850â250 Voters.
Mr. J. Plummer, C.                  130
Mr. J. C. Smith, C.                 116
Mr. J. Barker, L.                   101

Mr. Pullyn and Mr. R. Ferrier, jun., were the outgoing Councillors, and
the former was brought forward again by the Liberals, in conjunction with
Mr. Shelly, the Conservatives selecting Mr. H. Jay (who had formerly
contested the Nelson Ward unsuccessfully) as a colleague for Mr. Ferrier.
Messrs. Pullyn and Shelly refused even to canvass the electors, and
although some of their friends solicited the suffrages of the Ward for
them, there can be no doubt, however right in principle the
non-canvassing may be, it operated against them, and this, combined with
the constitutional principles upon which their election was conducted,
contributed to their defeat, money being freely spent on the other side.
Much regret is felt at this result, and especially at the loss of the
public services of Mr. Pullyn, after his having so long served the Ward,
and after his twice filling the office of Chief Magistrate in a manner
that won for him the praise even of his political opponents.

          _Nelson Ward_.
         1851â341 Voters.
Dr. Impey, L.                   132
Mr. S. V. Moore, L.             132
         1850â317 Voters.
Mr. G. D. Palmer, L.            121
Mr. T. Lettis, L.               119

The Conservatives did not contest this Ward, and Dr. Impey was
re-elected, in conjunction with Mr. Moore in the room of Mr. J. Symonds,
now non-resident.

          _Gorleston Ward_.
           1851â344 Voters.
Mr. S. Miller, C                   136
Mr. W. H. Palmer, C                135
Mr. J. H. Harrison, L               76
Mr. N. Sterry, L.                   74
           1850â337 Voters.
Mr. E. H. L. Preston, C            185
Mr. W. Hammond, C                  169
Mr. S. Crow, L                      78
Mr. Costerton, L                    64

This Ward was contested, but in rather a peculiar way, for although it
was supposed that some opposition to the outgoing Councillors would be
made, it was treated by the Conservatives as a âshamâ one, and such it
really seemed up to 12 oâclock, when the state of the poll came out with
upwards of 100 for Messrs. Miller and Palmer, and only about two votes
for each of their opponents!  This, however, was only a _ruse de guerre_,
and in a short time the voters came up almost in a body for Messrs.
Harrison and Sterry, who stated in their address that in âthe short space
of four hours they obtained 97 promises,â and had they been sooner in the
field it is thought they would have met with better success.

The result of the Elections has been a gain to the Conservative party of
two seats, and this reduces the two parties to a level in the Council;
the Liberals have still, however, a bare majority, and it is doubted
whether they will not be able to carry the Mayoralty for another year.
The Conservatives, it is said, intend nominating either Sir E. H. K.
Lacon, or (which is more likely) Mr. S. C. Marsh for that office, whilst
the names of Alderman E. R. Palmer and Alderman Bartram are spoken of by
the Liberals.

The Bishop of Norwich, attended by the Rev. S. Hills and his chaplain,
had inspected the Priory buildings, when they were received by J. H.
Hakewell, Esq., (the architect) and C. J. Palmer, Esq., (the hon.
secretary to the Committee).

Mr. Worlledge had moved the Court of Queenâs Bench for a â_quo warranto_â
to try the legality of Mr. Hammondâs election as a Councillor for the St.
Andrewâs Ward, and the rule had been granted.

Nov. 15th.âThe Hospital was badly supported, and it was stated that
unless Â£150 a year in additional subscriptions could be obtained, the
assistance afforded to sufferers must be abridged.

A lecture on âBloomerismâ had been delivered by Mrs. Knights at the Corn
Hall in full âBloomerâ costume, but she did not appear to have achieved a
marked success.

Dr. Wolff (the traveller) had offered to give some lectures in the town
in aid of the National Priory Schools.

At the Town Council for the Election of Mayor, a great crowd assembled
prior to the meeting, when Sir E. K. Lacon proposed, and Mr. Fenn
seconded, S. C. Marsh, Esq., to fill that office, and Mr. George
Danby-Palmer moved, and Mr. R. Hammond seconded, the re-election of
Captain Charles Pearson, R.N.  Upon the votes being taken, there appeared
for Captain PearsonâAldermen Pearson, Boulter, Bartram, Bayly, Fiddes,
Hammond, Pike, R. Hammond, jun., E. R. Palmer, and Barker; Councillors
Burroughs, Butcher, Cannell, Clarke, Chapman, Fish, Gourlay, Impey,
Jackson, Lettis, Moore, G. D. Palmer, and P. White; total, 23.  For Mr.
MarshâAlderman B. Fenn; Councillors C. Aldred, E. Aldred, Barber, Bessey,
Cherry, Ferrier, Ferrier, jun., J. Fenn, W. Hammond, B. Jay, H. Jay,
Lacon, Marsh, S. Miller, Nightingale, W. H. Palmer, Plummer, Preston,
Smith, Steward, F. Worship, and W. Worship; total, 23.  And the Mayor,
giving a casting vote for himself, declared himself duly elected.
Subsequently the Town Clerk (Mr. John Clowes) declared that he would not
continue in that office at the salary of Â£250, and it having been stated
that Mr. Charles Cory would accept it on those terms, he was elected Town
Clerk by 23 against 15 voices.  Mr. Cory then attended, was informed of
his election, and an order made on the late Clerk to hand over the papers
relating to the office to him.  In conclusion, the Editor expressed a
hope that âon no future occasion will any parties be allowed to violate
order and decorum in a way so disgraceful as they did on Monday last.â

45 members of the Council and others attended.

requisition of the electors, justifying the course he had taken with
regard to the Public Health Act.

A meeting had been held with regard to the new assessment, Mr. J. H.
Harrison in the chair.

The town had been visited with a tremendous gale, during which several
vessels had been blown out to sea.  At the time of the storm there were
700 sail between this port and Lowestoft.

The âEnterprise,â 600 tons, had been launched from Mr. Branfordâs Yard;
she was christened by Miss Barber and Miss Holt.

Dec. 6th.âA public meeting had been held at the Town-hall (Mr. J. H.
Harrison in the chair) for the purpose of considering the Poorâs Rate
assessment recently made.  About 400 persons attended, when the same was
condemned, and a subscription commenced for the purpose of disputing the
validity of it.

In respect of such proceedings, Mr. F. S. Costerton had been engaged as
solicitor to the owners of small tenements, and Mr. C. H. Chamberlin for
the general body of appellants, estimated at from 500 to 600 in number at
the least.

Dec. 13th.âAt the special meeting of the Town Council, âa scene of much
disorder and confusion arose out of some recriminations relative the late
Town-Clerk, between Mr. Burroughs and Mr. Preston.â

Dec. 20th.âOn the hearing of the assessment appeals, the rate was quashed
by the Justices on the ground of unequal assessment.  In these
proceedings Mr. Chamberlin appeared on behalf of the Committee of
Ratepayers, Mr. C. Cory for several private individuals, and Mr. Cufaude
for the Overseers.

Dec. 27thâThe Overseers had applied for, and obtained a fresh rate of 1s.
2d. in the Â£.

It had been determined in future not to use the âSt. Nicholasâ Seal,â
belonging to the Corporation, and for practical purposes a smaller seal
was to be made; the old one had been in use since about the year 1251.

The Race Committee had issued its report, from which it appeared that the
income had been, for the last year, Â£512 1s. 3d., as against Â£523 3s.
11d. expended.

    bread, was tried before the Recorder, N. Palmer, Esq., at the Quarter

    supplying the poor with bread of short weight; and, in the three last
    counts, with attempting to obtain payment from the Guardians, by
    falsely pretending that he had supplied full weight.  He was found
    guilty by the jury, but the Recorder reserved a case for the opinion
    of the Court of Criminal Appeal, as to the proprietory of the
    conviction in point of law.  On the first argument on April 29th,
    1854, before Pollock, C.B., Parke, B., Creswell, J., and Williams,
    J., the case was referred back to the Recorder, for him to state the

    case, as re-stated, was, on the following 3rd of June, argued before
    Lord Campbell, C. J., Alderson, B., Coleridge, J., Martin, B., and
    Crowder, J., and they, having doubts as to the proprietory of the
    conviction, desired the case to be argued before the 15 judges, and
    on the 2nd December, 1854, it was argued before Jervis, C. J.,
    Pollock, C. B., Parke, B., Maule, J., Wightman, J., Erle, J., Platt,
    B., Martin, B., and Crompton, J., and again on the 3rd of February
    last, before Jervis, C. J., Parke, B., Maule, J., Wightman, J.,
    Creswell, J., Erle, J., Platt, B., Williams, J., Martin, B., and
    Crompton, J.âMr. Bulwer appeared in support of the conviction, and
    Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Clerk, and Mr. J. H. Mills on behalf of the
    Defendant.  The Judges took time to consider, and on July the 9th,
    Mr. Baron Parke delivered their judgment, affirming the conviction on

    before the Recorder at the next October Sessions to receive
    judgment.â

Feb. 25th.âA case which excited considerable interest, had been heard at
the County Court, Tolhouse-hall, before the Judge (T. J. Birch, Esq.)
The plaintiff was Mr. John Cobb, leather merchant, for whom Mr. C. H.
Chamberlin appeared; the defendants were Messrs. W. N. Burroughs and G.
D. Palmer, who were represented by Mr. J. L. Cufaude.  The plaintiff
stated that he was a candidate for the office of Councillor for the
Market-ward, in November, 1851, and that he became such at the
solicitation of Messrs. W. N. Burroughs and G. D. Palmer.  At the time he
became a candidate he distinctly told them that he would not pay out of
his own pocket more than Â£10 towards the expenses of the election, and it
was understood that the Liberal party, to which he belonged, would
subscribe the remainder.  The evening before the election he received an
estimate of what the expenses were likely to be, and in consequence of
that he at once saw both Mr. Burroughs and Mr. G. D. Palmer.  That
estimate, he believed, amounted to about Â£45, while the subscriptions
altogether amounted to but Â£42.  After some conversation they agreed to
hold him harmless of the amount of the expenses that might exceed the sum
subscribed, and he and Mr. Burroughs then went to the Committee-room of
the North-ward, where Mr. Burroughs said they had made arrangements for
their friend John Cobb winning the Market-ward.  The expenses of the
election, which he (the plaintiff) lost, amounted altogether to Â£58 1s.
7d.  The balance, therefore, which he now claimed from the defendants was
Â£16 1s. 7d.âThe plaintiff, in cross-examination by Mr. Cufaude, admitted
that Â£39 of the whole amount was for â â.âMr. Cufaude contended that if,
as the plaintiff stated, the defendants had given him a guarantee for the
surplus expenses, the guarantee ought to have been in writing.  And,
assuming the evidence was true, which, however, he disputed, it was
impossible for the plaintiff to recover, inasmuch as he himself had
allowed that a large part of the whole of the expenses was for â â, which
was an illegal act.âMr. Chamberlin contended that the plaintiff, after
receiving the promise from the defendants, acted only upon the faith of
that promise, and that therefore, as they had entered upon an engagement
to pay the money, they were liable.  The money, moreover, had not been
spent by the plaintiff, but by the committee appointed to conduct the
election, and until the election was over, the plaintiff was not aware
that any of the money had been spent in â â.âHis Honour said it was clear
the guarantee should have been in writing.  He was of opinion, also, that
the plaintiff was not bound to pay the illegal charges, and consequently
he could not bring his action for the money which he claimed.âThe
plaintiff was, accordingly, non-suited.

Oct. 21st.âContains the following report:ââA Vestry meeting was held in
the Town-hall, on Friday, for the purpose of considering the propriety of
making a Church rate.  There was a large attendance; the minister of the
parish (the Rev. G. Hills, B.D.), of course presided.âThe Chairman, in
opening the proceedings, stated that the rate which would be proposed
would be, in all respects, a legal one; it would include a charge for St.
Peterâs Church, as the Churchwardens had been advised that that edifice
was chargeable upon the rate in the same way that the Parish Church was.
With regard to the new church of St. Johnâs, a fund had been raised which
would be invested for keeping it in repair, so that it might never become
chargeable to the parishioners.  The Churchwardens, in order to preserve
as much harmony as possible, would only ask for a rate for the repair of
the fabrics, and for the payment of such legal charges as they were
compelled to include in the rate; the items which would be left out
would, therefore, amount to between Â£60 and Â£70, and would have to be
defrayed by voluntary contribution.âMessrs. C. S. D. Steward and E. R.
Aldred, the Churchwardens, moved and seconded that a rate of 1Â½d. in the
pound be levied for the ensuing year; the amounts which it was estimated
would be required wereâfor the Parish Church, Â£142 5s. 4d.; for St.
Georgeâs Chapel, Â£32 6s. 6d.; for St. Peterâs Church Â£32; and for general
purposes Â£35.âMr. W. T. Fisher moved, and Mr. J. Lawn seconded, âThat at
a time when it is expected that the Government will pass a bill for the
abolition of Church rates, it appears to this vestry that it is
inexpedient to increase the rates by including St. Peterâs Church, as it
may ultimately add to increased taxation.â  Mr. Fisher also moved, and
Mr. Joseph Neave seconded, âThat time be given for the ratepayers to
examine the estimates, and that the meeting do therefore adjourn for
three weeks for that purpose.ââThe Chairman refused to put either of the
above amendmentsâthe first because Mr. Fisher would not alter it by
leaving out the words âBy including St. Peterâs Church,â and the second
because he did not consider it to be a _bona fide_ objection.âMr. Fisher
entered written protests, signed by himself, against the decision of the
chairman, which protests he requested might be entered in the Vestry
Clerkâs minutes of the meeting.âMr. J. H. Harrison moved, âThat until
after the committee, which was appointed in April last to confer with the
Churchwardens relative to the property belonging to the Parish Church,
had made its report to a further vestry, it is inexpedient to make a
rate.â  Mr. F. Starling seconded the amendment.âThe Chairman, in
endeavouring to prevail upon Mr. Harrison to withdraw his amendment,
stated that in March next, property which now let at from Â£29 to Â£30 a
year, and that in September, 1859, property which now realised Â£50 per
annum, would fall in; he agreed with them that the greatest care ought to
be taken in properly administering this property, and said he believed
its value would be increased threefold.âThe amendment was carried by an
immense majority, and the meeting, therefore, was adjourned _sine die_.

Oct. 28th.âMany vessels had been lost, and amongst them the âBetsyâ (G.
D. Palmer, Esq., owner), on Palling Beach.  (N.B.âShe was at that time

Palmer family for more than 100 years.)

Oct. 31st.âThe Liberal electors had held a grand soireÃ¨ at the Town Hall,
Messrs. A. W. Young, M.P., and J. Mellor, Q.C., M.P., being present; 220
persons attended, amongst whom were R. Hammond, Esq., (Chairman), and
Messrs. G. D. Palmer, J. W. Shelley, W. N. Burroughs, P. Pullyn, C. E.

D. Palmer, D. B. Palmer, W. T. Fisher, J. Cobb, J. Mainprice, W. Briggs,
J. H. Harrison, J. Owles, J. Neave, &c.  Mr. McCullagh was unable to

The adjourned Vestry Meeting for the purpose of considering the propriety
of making a Church rate had been held in the Town Hall.  There was a
large attendance of ratepayers, who were, of course, presided over by the
minister of the parish.  The Committee appointed to consider the value of
the Church property recommended that that which had fallen in, and which
would fall in on the 25th of March next, should be re-let on repairing
leases of 14 yearsâ duration, at a rental of Â£76 16s.âMr. J. H. Harrison,
one of the committee, gave a detailed account of all the Church property,
both of that which fell in in September last, and that which will fall in
during next year and 1859 and 1860.  He had no doubt, whatever, that if
the property was properly managed, there would be no necessity for asking
for a Church rate after 1860.âMr. C. S. D. Steward and Mr. E. R. Aldred,
the Churchwardens, moved and seconded respectively, âThat in consequence
of the increased rental of the estate belonging to St. Nicholasâ Church
not being available for the current year, a rate of 1Â½d in the pound be
now made and assessed.ââMr. J. H. Harrison thought that St. Peterâs
Church ought not to be included in the rate, and moved as an amendment,
âThat St. Peterâs Church having been erected by voluntary contributions,
with an understanding that it should be maintained and supported by its
pew rents, and should in no way become a charge upon the parish, this
Vestry deems it advisable to refuse making a rate until the Churchwardens
do exclude the said Church of St. Peter wholly from their estimate.ââMr.
J. Lawn seconded the amendment, but the Chairman refused to put it, on
the ground that he could not consistently with his duty do so.âAfter
considerable discussion, in the course of which the Clerk stated that St.
Peterâs Church could be legally included in the rate, Mr. W. T. Fisher
moved, and Mr. J. Lawn seconded, on the ground that the Church property,
if re-let at its full value, would realize more than sufficient for the
necessary repairs of the Parish Church, and that money, which could
afterwards be repaid out of the surplus, could be borrowed to defray the
expenses for the next two years,ââThat this meeting resolves to adjourn
for four weeks, to obtain the necessary amount and thereby to avoid the
necessity of making a Church rate.ââThe Chairman conscientiously refused
to put this amendment on the ground that it was not a _bona fide_ one,
and also the following amendment, which was likewise moved by Mr. W. T.
Fisher, âThat in order to give the Churchwardens time to prepare a proper
estimate, the Vestry to adjourn for three weeks.ââMr. J. H. Harrison then
moved, âThat it is inexpedient and inadvisable to make a Church rate at
this meeting.ââThe Chairman, however, refused to put this, as also
another amendment by Mr. J. H. Harrison to the effect, âThat a Church
rate of a farthing in the pound be levied.ââAfter a great deal of uproar,
the motion of the Churchwardens was lost by a considerable majority.  A
poll was then demanded, when the Chairman appointed Mr. J. L. Cufaude to
be the assessor, and the meeting adjourned.  The following numbers were
polled during the afternoon:âFor the rate 225, against it 195.

Nov. 18th.âThe polling of the Vestry had been concluded as follows:â

For the Rate            651
Against                 771

and at 10 oâclock on Saturday, Mr. Hills stated that the poll would not
be re-opened.

On the following day (Sunday) the clocks at the Parish Church and St.
Georgeâs Chapel were stopped, and the bells âtolledâ at the hour for
performance of divine service.

with a Christmas dinner by the Mayor.

1858.


Jan. 2nd.âContains the following article on the Old Year:ââ1857 has been
a good year for our port.  Our fisheries have prospered; our mercantile
and shipping report is favourable; and our commercial credit has stood
firm and upright against the pressure of a severe monetary crisis.  We
have proved the elasticity of our resources, and have demonstrated the
strength and stability of our enterprise.  The fashionable season has
also been one on which we have to congratulate ourselves.  During the
summer and autumn of 1857, Yarmouth was full of visitors; our beach was
crowded with company; and our hotels and lodging houses were all full.
In short, on New Yearâs Day we find that we can strike a balance on the
right side, and look forward with hope based on the solid foundation of
proved success.  There is but one great drawback to the seasonable
satisfaction such a state of things affords.  Our political divisions
have materially diminished the account in our favour, and have seriously
interfered with the social harmony of the town.  We have suffered
ourselves to be led away into personal altercations, and have so departed
from the straight road of a defined and thought-out principle.  This has
been a grave mistake, as we are now beginning to discover.  But generally
we have yet to learn that political zeal is not inconsistent with the
courtesies of society, and that ill-tempered advocacy is worse than
useless.  Let us hope, however, that the moderate men of both political
opinions, who must, we are sure, see the error of this course, will for
the future guard against indiscretions, which are as inherently wrong as
they are manifestly prejudicial to any cause that stands upon Principle
and is supported by its own Truth.  We know we express the opinion of the
thinking portion of the constituency in advising an abstinence from the
littleness of factious strife, and in suggesting a more elevated view of
political verities, we are satisfied we are answering to the wish of the
most respectable members of the opposing parties, and are explaining what
is only wanting to consolidate the established prosperity of Yarmouth.â

Owles, and Mr. George Danby-Palmer moved, and Mr. Chapman seconded, an
amendment in favour of such appointments, which, on a division, was lost
by 25 to 5 votes.  The Mayor made some warm remarks of a personal nature,

and laughter of the members, the meeting breaking up in great confusion.â

April 23rd.âContains the following report as to

                               âTHE ELECTION.â

    The greatest activity prevails on both sides, and as the decisive day
    approaches, the feelings of partizanship are becoming greatly
    intensified.  The printers have had a lively time of it, and turn out
    a great quantity of matter, an opinion appearing to be prevalent that
    quality is a secondary consideration.  During the last few days,
    songs, parodies upon songs, speeches, and gross personal abuse have
    been issued by the supporters of Mr. Watkin, (for it must be admitted
    that Mr. Young holds himself aloof from this scurrility) with the
    object, we suppose, of doing that gentleman some good.  In our
    opinion they will have a contrary effect, as we have heard many
    respectable Liberal electors express themselves disgusted with such
    unnecessary vulgarity.  It may be very true, that in addressing the
    people, it is necessary to call a spade a spade, but it cannot be at
    all requisite that the minds of the people should be attempted to be
    influenced by strong specimens of the Billingsgate vocabulary.  Where
    wit is lacking, silence is preferable to blackguardism.  On the
    Conservative side there has also been a fair number of coloured bills
    and printed addresses issued; but the writers in this interest have
    abstained from attempting to be funny.  In printed abuse, however,
    they endeavour to rival their opponents.  Betting, if that may be
    considered a piece of electioneering business, is decidedly in favour
    of the Conservative candidates.  Each party attributes motives of the
    most improper kind to the other, and it will be seen that Mr. Watkin
    fears that his opponents may indulge in âcorruption.â  On the other
    hand, Sir E. Lacon says voters had told him they dare not support
    him, as they should be inclined to do, in consequence of persons on
    the Liberal side having put the âscrewâ upon them.  Tradesmen
    generally will be glad when the contest is over, as it is daily
    creating much personal animosity.

The âAthelstanâ had been launched; she was of 500 tons burden, and was to
take out Bishop Hillsâ effects to British Columbia.

The âHaddiscoe Swampâ had caused a great difficulty on the East Suffolk
line, which was consequently still not open for traffic.

William Howlett, âRedâ bill-poster, and Robert Crisp, âBlueâ bill-poster,
had been before the Magistrates owing to a dispute arising out of the
election placards.

April 30th.âBoth parties had been holding nightly meetings of a
âconvivial character.â  On Wednesday some 300 to 400 persons had paraded
the town shouting âDown with Lacon and Stracey,â and had broken the
windows of the Red Committee rooms in the Market-place.

                               âTHE NOMINATIONâ

    took place on the Hall Plain; the platform, in the centre of which
    was reserved a place for the Mayor and the Candidates and friends,
    being on the Crown and Anchor âleads.â  The Blues were to the left of
    the Mayor and the Reds to his right; and in front of the house there
    was at the time proceedings commenced an assemblage numbering 4,000
    or 5,000, including a number of females.  The Liberals were the first
    to arrive on the âleads,â and on Mr. Watkin showing himself to the
    crowd, he was loudly cheered, a compliment which the candidate duly
    acknowledged.  Shortly afterwards the approach of the Conservative
    party was indicated by the deep groans of the crowd, who manifested
    some indications of hostility: but on its being discovered that the
    Conservative cavalcade was headed by a party of very
    pugilistic-looking persons, decorated with red ribbon, the
    threatening attitude of the crowd was somewhat modified, and the two
    Baronets, with their friends, were allowed to ascend to the âleadsâ
    unmolested.  When the two parties had taken their places on the
    balcony, the Liberals proposed three cheers, which were given by the
    great majority, accompanied by the groans of the minority.  A number
    of âbeeryâ individuals struggled to the front, and were a source of
    annoyance to the speakers throughout.  A few minutes before three
    oâclock the Mayor arrived in state, preceded by his
    sergeants-at-mace, and accompanied in his carriage by Mr. C. J.
    Palmer, who acted as his solicitor for the occasion.  When his
    Worship appeared in the balcony the Blues, for some reason, commenced
    hissing him, much to the disgust of several of the leading gentlemen
    of the Liberal party, who protested against such unseemly
    proceedings.  We may state, before attempting to report the numerous
    speeches that were delivered, that during the whole of the
    proceedingsâmore especially when it was the turn of the Conservatives
    to speakâthe crowd was exceedingly disorderly, and by their loud
    shouting and groaning rendered most of the speakers inaudable to
    persons a few yards distant from them.  The Mayor was grossly
    insulted at the commencement, and as the proceedings progressed
    several fights were got up, and the interference of the police was
    frequently required.  Anything more unreasonable and unreasoning than
    the majority of the crowd it would be impossible to conceive, and
    when the nomination closed there did not seem to be any person in the
    balcony opposed to the opinion of the Mayorâthat the âwhole thing was
    a farce.â  One side of the question was not heard at all, and the
    majority shouted without knowing what about.  This was singularly
    illustrated during the speech of Mr. Watkin, when that gentleman took
    upon himself the functions of the returning-officer, by calling upon
    the crowd for a show of hands, which, singularly enough, was against
    him.  Mr. Watkin said, âAll those that donât want me to go to the
    poll, hold up their hands.â  A forest of hands was exhibited to the
    great amusement of the Conservatives, who cheered the result.  Mr.
    Watkin then told his friends that they were mistaken, and having
    explained the mistake to them, assuring them that they were too
    intelligent to vote him down, he took another show of hands, which
    was in his favour.  We shall be excused for commenting upon the
    proceedings here; but the disorder and noise was so great that, as
    most of the speakers could not be heard, we are necessitated to do
    it, in order to make our report intelligible.  From the beginning to
    the end ânoiseâ had it in numbers; but in fighting the honour seemed
    to be with the Reds, who exhibited considerable proficiency in the
    pugilistic art.  The crowd, which was very closely packed, was
    divided into two sections, the Blue and the Red, the former having
    about ten to one of the latter.  At times both sections were very
    ill-behaved, but their misconduct was kindly overlooked by the whole
    of the speakers except Mr. Watkin, who took the liberty of
    designating the minority of the âpeopleâ as âscoundrelsâ and
    âruffians.â  These polite designations appeared likely to stir up the
    ill-blood of the people, inasmuch as four or five fights immediately
    commenced, in one of which an unfortunate fellow sustained a severe
    fracture of the proboscis, and it was not until the Mayor had, to use
    a significant local word, âcheckedâ Mr. Watkin, and warned him
    against the violent nature of his harangue, that comparative order
    was restored.  The fights in question are deserving of notice.  One
    began between a female, whose bonnet was trimmed with yellow ribbon,
    and a stout man in a blue guernsey.  Gallant Reds and Blues rushed
    into the affray, doubtless with the object of protecting the woman,
    and there was every probability of a general set-to.  The Mayor,
    however, directed the police to interfere, and the contest was
    suppressed, with apparently no worse results than the infliction of a
    few disagreeable blows on the frontispieces of the combatants.  The
    other fights were of less importance; but altogether this display of
    pugnacity had the effect of causing the outside portion of the crowd
    to run away from what they considered to be danger.  Other fights, as
    will be seen from the report, also occurred.  One feature in the
    general noise was much remarked by the gentlemen on the balcony, and
    as it was amusing we notice it.  A half drunken beachman or
    fisherman, just so far gone as to be witty, but who was unmistakeably
    a Blue, planted himself in front of the balcony, and by his
    extraordinary shouting succeeded in making himself heard above the
    surrounding tumult.  There was some natural humour about this fellow,
    and the way in which he shouted excited the laughter of the Mayor and
    both parties on the balcony.  The man shouted until the veins grew
    large in his forehead; he jumped and screamedâhe laughed and waved
    his hat, and others laughed with himâindeed, for a time all laughed
    with him; he was in a state of ecstacy or violent enthusiasm.  It was
    difficult for a time to make out what the man meant, but at length he
    was understood, and his fun was appreciated.  Sir E. Lacon wears a
    full moustache, and so does Sir H. Stracey, and those hirsute
    ornaments were the objects of this excited individualâs enthusiasm.
    He laughed and shoutedâhis voice being heard above the murmur of the
    crowd,âfor fully an hour,ââThe beard! the beard! will nobody shave
    him?  A shave! a shave!  Fetch a barber! fetch a barber!â(Loud
    laughter.)âA clean shave!  A shilling for a razor! a razor! a razor!
    O Lord, a clean shave,â &c.  Ultimately the man climbed to the top of
    a post, and threw his hat into the face of a railway porter; the
    porter ran to him and struck him in the mouth two or three times,
    with a force that evidently astonished him, and as his scream then
    became somewhat distressing, he was ignominiously removed to the
    outside of the crowd.  Many other noticeable incidents occurred,
    which will be found mentioned in our report.  But there is one
    circumstance which did not altogether develop itself at the meeting,
    that we feel compelled to notice.  Society, from experience, knows
    that the prude is the loudest and severest advocate of virtue; but,
    as Josephus has remarked, âEvery man will think of this as it seemeth
    good unto him.â  We have noticed the Gorleston voters, we have
    recorded the boastings and professions on both sides, and we have
    ventilated rumours which have been so far well founded.  The incident
    we are about to mention we can vouch for; it is possible, should
    circumstances necessitate it, of being proved.  On the Wednesday
    evening, mob law, intimidation, corruption, âthe screw,â and all the
    worst elements of electioneering were resorted to; and we regret to
    say that the parties who most publicly exhibited themselves as
    disorderlies were persons whom we wonât classify, but who cried out,
    âDown with Lacon and Straceyâ and âThree cheers for Watkin.â

                           âTHE TIN CANISTER.â

A report had been âcurrent that a mysterious old gentleman had arrived
from somewhere with a tin canister full of sovereigns, and from the way
in which he was dressed it was generally supposed that he was either a
Russian or a Shrewsbury man come for the purpose of bribery.  âSaid
person,â as the Yankees say, was seen in the rear of the balcony at the
Crown and Anchor, defying anybody to penetrate the secret of his
identity, but occasionally winking and ejaculating, with an occasionally
eructory sound, the words, âAll rightâin for Watkin.â  This strange
gentleman departed in the evening, minus, it is said, the canister.  We
will now pass over the irregularities of the story, and give you the
words of our informant, whose high standing and character place him
beyond suspicion:ââI had attended the Yarmouth nomination, and took my
railway seat, at 8.40 p.m. for Norwich.  There were two or three
gentlemen in the first-class compartment in which I had placed myself;
and one gentleman was a peculiar sort of mysterious individual.  After
eyeing the party well, the gentleman gravely said, âBoth sides are
buying, Iâm afraid, at Yarmouth.â  One of the party doubted the
assertion, but the ancient traveller smiled and said, âNo, no.â  Further
explanations took place, until at length our interesting fellow-traveller
volunteered this remark, after a feeler from one of the party, âYou know
I came down from Manchester yesterday, to see my particular friend Wâ.
Deuced clever fellowâone of the best railway men in the country.  He did
wonders for the Manchester and Lincolnshire line, and if we get him in we
shall expect him to be one of the best railway men we have.â  One of the
party asked, âAre you a Yarmouth voter, sir?â  Old Traveller: âNo, but I
wished to see my friend Wâ on very particular business, and so I just
came down to Yarmouth to see how his election was getting on _as well_,
and to add my mite of influence.â  This, perhaps, will account for the
story of the tin canister.  The rest we shall leave to the report.â

Mr. J. Cherry proposed, and Mr. R. Dumbleton seconded Sir E. H. K. Lacon.

Mr. R. Hammond proposed, and Mr. J. Owles seconded Mr. Watkin.

Mr. E. H. L. Preston proposed, and Mr. S. C. Marsh seconded Sir H. J.
Stracey,

Regent                  112           108            91           88
St. Georgeâs            102            94            89           84
Nelson                  166           153           119          106
St. Andrewâs            105           102            93           88
         Total          699           659           568          536

But it was stated that âthere were many cases of bribery, and the
defeated party threatened a petition against this âreturn.ââ

E. Frere, F. Palmer, F. Ferrier, T. Brightwen, Captain Holmes, Dr. Smith,
Rev. Nevill, Johnson, &c.

June 1st.âContains the following report of a

               âMEETING TO ESTABLISH A VOLUNTEER RIFLE CORPS.â

    On Friday, a meeting, called by the Mayor, was held at the Town Hall,
    to take into consideration certain communications which his worship
    had received from General Peel, the Secretary at War, and Lord
    Leicester, the Lord Lieutenant of the County.  There was a very
    numerous attendance.  Amongst the gentlemen present wereâSir E.
    Lacon, Bart., M.P., Lieutenant Colonel Beckham, Captain Naylor,
    Captain Holmes, Rev. J. B. Bampton, Rev. T. Lowe, Messrs. J. H. Orde,
    F. Worship, W. Worship, W. Yetts, S. C. Marsh, C. C. Aldred, C. J.
    Palmer, E. H. L. Preston, J. Clowes, Foreman, &c.

    The Mayor stated that he had called the meeting in consequence of
    communications he had received from General Peel and the Lord
    Lieutenant, and in compliance with a requisition which he had
    received, and which was signed by seventy gentlemen.  He read General
    Peelâs letter and the requisition.  He had prepared no resolution or
    anything of that sort, but should leave the gentlemen assembled to
    propose anything they might think proper.

    Mr. W. Worship said the subject upon which they had been called
    together was one upon which there could be no difference of
    opinionâ(hear, hear)âand in order to put the proceedings into a
    practical form, he should move that a committee be appointed, which
    would include Sir E. Lacon and Mr. Orde.

    Mr. R. Ferrier said he had much pleasure in seconding the motion, and
    he hoped it would be understood that, although they were forming a
    military corps, such men as himself might be allowed to contribute to
    the expenses which would be incurred in its formation.  There were,
    doubtless, many men in the town who could afford to pay for the
    accoutrements and give up the necessary time; but there was also in
    the town a fine class of men, in every way eligible, who could not
    afford that.  It was, therefore, in assisting the latter class that
    such men as himself could be useful.  (Hear, hear.)  He should be
    glad himself to pay the annual expenses of some man who could not
    afford to do it himself; and had no objection to put his name down at
    once for Â£10 a year.  (Hear, hear.)

    Mr. S. C. Marsh said he did not wish to interrupt the proceedings;
    but before they formed the committee he thought they should, by some
    resolution, declare it desirable to form a Rifle Corps.  (Hear,
    hear.)  Having decided to form a corps, the next step would be to
    form a committee to carry out the necessary arrangements.  He was
    sure Englishmen would respond to the offer that had been made them to
    allow themselves to form volunteer corps for the defence of the
    country.  Norfolk had never been behindhand in the manifestation of
    patriotic feeling, and he hoped that would not be the case on this
    occasion.  Yarmouth had before shown what she could do for the
    Governments of England and the defence of the country, and he hoped
    she was prepared to do something now.  (Hear, hear.)  He begged to
    move âThat it is expedient to establish a Volunteer Rifle Corps for
    Great Yarmouth and its vicinity.â

    Mr. Ferrier seconded.âCarried unanimously.

    Sir E. Lacon, M.P. said he thought it highly essential that a town
    like Yarmouth should take a stand and come forward at once in
    obedience to the proclamation that had been issued by the Queen.
    They must all put their shoulders to the wheel, and wherever they saw
    a fine young fellow who was a likely man for the corps, if he did not
    come forward they must ask him to do so.  The duty they had to do
    that day was very slight indeed, but for his own part, he would say
    that he should give the movement all the encouragement that he
    possibly could.  (Hear, hear.)  He should now move that a committee
    be appointed, with power to appoint a sub-committee, and with
    directions to go round the town and see what force could be got up.
    (Hear, hear.)  Yarmouth was a large town it was true, but there were
    also districts around it out of which to draw much assistance; but he
    certainly thought it would be desirable to take in the Flegg Hundreds
    and the Island.

    Mr. J. Clowes said there were many men in the town who, from age and
    other causes, would be unable to serve in a rifle corps, but who
    would be very desirous of taking part in the defence of our
    shoresâmen who were too old to sleep all night in the marsh ditches,
    or under hedges.  (Laughter.)  For that class of men, he thought
    there should be an Artillery Corps, as many of them, though not fit
    to take the field, would be ready to man a gun or work a battery.

    The Mayor said it was out of the scope of the present meeting to
    discuss an Artillery Corps.

    Mr. Orde said Government had intended that they would sanction and
    approve the formation of Artillery Corps.

    Mr. Marshâs motion was then put and carried.

    Sir E. Lacon, in answer to Dr. Stephenson, said it would, no doubt,
    be a desirable thing to have a mounted Rifle Corps, only they could
    not get the horses, and if they could get them, many would be unable
    to keep them, besides which he should object, unless he wished to see
    some of them killed, to their mounting horses.  (Loud laughter.)  But
    he might say that, at an agricultural dinner, where he was the other
    day, he heard the farmers express themselves strongly in favour of a
    mounted force in the Fleggs and the Island.

    Mr. C. J. Palmer suggested that all who wished to support the corps,
    either by serving in it or by their subscriptions, should come
    forward and put down their names at once.  (Hear, hear.)

    The Mayor said he would take down the names of any gentlemen who
    wished to join the corps.  When they saw who were willing to join,
    they might name a committee, and appoint some gentleman to act as
    secretary.  That being done, the future conduct of the movement would
    remain with the committee.

    The following gentlemen then gave in their names as members of the
    corps:âSir E. H. K. Lacon, M.P., Sir H. Stracey, M.P.,
    Lieutenant-Colonel Beckham, S. C. Marsh, C. J. Palmer, B. Jay, R.
    Ferrier, W. Worship, F. Palmer, F. Worship, W. J. Foreman, W. C.
    Reynolds, S. Aldred, Dr. Stephenson, J. H. Orde, G. Harvey, G. Baker,
    Rev. J. B. Bampton, H. Teasdel, J. W. Bunn, Captain Holmes, C. Brown,
    J. Tomlinson, H. R. Harmer, G. Diver, H. H. Barber, J. Franklin, E.
    Fyson, J. B. Stevens, J. Playford, G. B. Costerton, H. Teasdel, T. P.
    Burroughs, Ambrose Palmer, A. W. Morant, Rev. T. Lowe, and J. Clowes.

    Mr. R. Ferrier moved that the foregoing be appointed a committee to
    carry out the arrangements for establishing the corps, with power to
    appoint a sub-committee; and that Colonel Beckham be requested to act
    as honorary secretary.

    The motion was carried unanimously, and the book containing the list
    of names was ordered to be left at the Police-station during the
    ensuing week, to give persons desirous of joining the corps an
    opportunity of entering their names.

    The proceedings then concluded.

June 8th.âThe Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club had held its first meeting
on Breydon Water, and subsequently the members (who appeared in Club
uniform) dined at the Club House (Norfolk Hotel), when the healths of
Colonel Wilson, Commodore; F. Brown, Esq., Vice-Commodore; Mr. Everitt,
of Cove Hall, (father of the Club); Mr. Scott, Aylsham, and others were

opinion,â and the former gentleman had declined to accept the â_amende
honorable_â tendered him by the latter.

It was stated that some 60 persons were ready to join the Rifle Corps.

July 4th contains the following account of the

                         VISIT OF THE CHANNEL FLEET.

    The Channel Fleet has at length visited our Roads, much to the
    gratification of thousands of the Queenâs lieges, as well as to the
    galling disappointment of thousands of the same excellent body.  The
    squadron came in in the open day, clear to the gaze of multitudes,
    but disappeared like a majestic phantom in the night.  A little more
    than a week ago we were informed that the Channel Fleet had, after an
    anchorage of sixteen days in St. Margaretâs Hope, Frith of Forth,
    left its moorings under canvas, with auxiliary steam power, and
    proceeded down the Frith and out to sea, destined for the Yarmouth
    Roads.  As we stated in our last impression, the consequence of that
    information being diffused was to put all the speculators and
    quidnuncs of the town and neighbourhood on the alert.  Leaving St.
    Margaretâs Hope on the Saturday, the fleet would certainly, it was
    argued, be here on the Tuesday, on which day the Marine Parade and
    the Beach were literally swarmed with expectant people, whose glasses
    were searching the waters in every direction; but, owing either to
    the perversity of Admiral Neptune, the weather office, or the
    Vice-Admiral in command (who is admitted by everyone to be a pleasant
    and courteous gentleman), the fleet did not arrive.  Much
    disappointment and innumerable prophecies followed, and while some
    knowing individuals averred positively, and âon undoubted authorityâ
    that the fleet had passed and would not come in here, others were
    equally confident, on the strength of telegrams and âunquestionable
    information,â that the great ships would be seen, on the ânext
    flood.â  As, however, they put in no appearance up to Friday evening,
    the conviction that they had omitted us began to be pretty general,
    especially when âundoubted authorityâ satisfied us that the squadron
    had been seen some distance to the south of this port, namely, in the
    Wold.  A few persons held out, notwithstanding their belief that the
    ships would visit us, and were stirring early on Saturday morning to
    catch the latest intelligence, when lo! the rumour spread that the
    fleet was in sight.  People began hurrying to the Beach, which,
    between 8 and 10 oâclock a.m. presented, as to throng and bustle, an
    appearance equal to that of Tuesday, with the single exception that
    the fair sex had not had time to put on the gay attire in which they
    looked so well on that day.  As the Royal Albert, three decker, flag
    ship of Vice-Admiral Freemantle, came in sight, the cry was, âThere
    they are!â and as the magnificent vessel steamed up into the gat
    there appeared something so triumphant and majestic in her appearance
    as to make every one who saw her feel proud of the âwooden walls,â
    which have so long defied all the enemies of Old England.  Britannia
    from the top of the lofty pedestal in front of the gatway might look
    down with pride upon the splendid ship which marched in stately
    grandeur âoâer the mountain waves.â  The Royal Albert was seen to be
    followed by a long dark line of smoke, and every few minutes other
    great ships came in sight moving apparently with ease and
    controllable but irresistible force.  As the flagship came through
    the gat of St. Nicholas, the dense masses of people who lined the
    shore expressed in a variety of forms their admiration of the
    dimensions and commanding aspect of this great three decker.  The
    seafaring people looked at the matter with a professional eye, and
    amongst them might frequently be heard such expressions as âOld
    Rounce (the Gorleston pilot) is bringing her in stunnin!â  On came
    the great ship,âas gracefully and as gently as a swan would move upon
    the surface of an untroubled lake,âuntil she was surprisingly near
    the shore for a ship of her size.  She then glided round in a most
    beautiful manner, as if looking for the best place to drop her
    anchor, a point which was soon decided, when it was found that she
    was in about an exact line with the Victoria Hotel.  The sight in the
    gatway had now become grand in the extreme, as all the line of battle
    ships were in sight, moving majestically forward by the aid of power
    unseen, while the flagship was actively engaged in signalling to the
    various ships as they came up as to the respective positions they
    were to take.  The ships seemed to be managed with perfect ease, and
    could be turned or moved in any direction with surprising celerity.
    The scene while they were taking up their positions and dropping
    their anchors was beautiful and will not soon be forgotten by those
    who saw it.

    The Locust, steam tender, had arrived in the Roads previously, and
    the ships that arrived with the Royal Albert, which has 121 guns, and
    carries 1,100 men, were the Edgar, 91, flagship of the Rear-Admiral
    Erskine, the Mersey frigate, 40; the Donegal, 101; the Trafalgar, 91;
    the Conqueror, the Centurion, the Mars, the Diadem, the Algiers, the
    Aboukir, and the Greyhound corvette, 17, acting as tender to the
    Royal Albert.  The fleet anchored in two lines, and presented a most
    gratifying spectacle to the inhabitants, who felt what a security it
    must be in a time of war, while at the same time they could not
    refrain from reflecting on the terrible havoc that must be committed
    were those quiet-looking ships to unbosom their thunders, and vent
    their indignation upon the town for a space of about five minutes.
    Soon after the Vice-Admiralâs flag ship had anchored, the Volunteer
    Artillery fired a salute of 15 guns, but owing to the regulations of
    the service, the ship was precluded from returning the compliment.
    The band of the Artillery subsequently played on the Drive, and gave
    a festive character to the morning.  Reports rapidly got afloat as to
    how long the fleet would stay, some contending that it would not go
    till Wednesday, as the Admiral and officers had accepted an
    invitation to a ball which the Mayor purposed giving at the Town Hall
    on Tuesday evening; while, on the other hand, it was asserted that
    the fleet would depart in the course of the night, as during the day
    they received five or six despatches from the Admiralty, and thus
    disappoint the thousands who it was expected would come into the town
    by rail on Sunday.  Neither of the predictions turned out to be true.
    Had the ships not been detained at sea by the contrary winds, which
    caused them to keep steam up even to the last, they would have been
    here for four or five days.  Before coming in they had for two or
    three days been within 60 miles of us, trying to reach here with
    their sails alone.  They had not been long at anchor before sundry
    mariners and bare-footed frolicsome and reckless tars, were seen
    ashore, lugging away immense baskets of fresh bread, butter, &c., and
    diversifying this duty by fraternising with as many of the girlhood
    of the place as they happened to come in contact with.  The Blue
    Jackets are decided favourites ashore, and few people seem disposed
    to prevent them doing as they please.  It would give great
    satisfaction to the inhabitants of this town, if, in their annual
    cruises, the Channel Squadron would occasionally drop in here, for we
    are sure that their present visit, besides being advantageous to the
    town, will obtain many seamen; for who would wander about in a rotten
    and miserable old collier when he might lead a worthy and a jolly
    life amongst excellent fellows, on board a floating tower and mansion
    equal to the most convenient and best regulated establishments
    ashore?  It is a long time since a fleet was seen in our Roads,
    although there is probably no point upon the coast where so much
    shipping passes as this.  The last fleet that was in the Roads was in
    1810, under the command of Admiral Somers, whose flagship was the
    Victory (Nelsonâs old ship), and that fleet passed here on its way to
    the Baltic, the ports of which it was going to blockade.  There were
    then in the fleet besides the Admiralâs ship of 98 guns, the
    Formidable, 98; the St. George, 98; the Dreadnought, 98, now a
    hospital ship, and a number of 74âs, making together fourteen sail,
    some of which were with Admiral Sir John Ross, at the blockade of
    Dantzic, in 1812 (and frozen up there in 1813).  In 1801, Nelson was
    in here on his way to Copenhagen, and in 1807, Admiral Gambierâs
    fleet was bound for the same place, and sailing hence fetched in the
    ships and stores of the Danes.  In the time of those fleets, the
    North Sea and Baltic Pilots of this port were of great serviceâa
    class of men of whom, we believe, only one remains.  His name is
    Richard Webb.  He was frozen up in the Baltic in 1812, while acting
    as pilot (wintered there during the burning of Moscow), and was
    altogether engaged for 15 years in piloting government vessels in the
    wars of that time, important services for which the old boy alleges
    he has received nothing but unfulfilled promises from the âgreat
    gunsâ aloft.  One would think that an old sailor who had served in
    the âbattle and the breezeâ for so long a period, and in such
    momentous times, ought to have received some substantial recognition
    of his services.

    The fleet and the officers and men from it who came ashore during the
    day have been closely scrutinized and gazed at, parties having been
    on board the flagship, it became a question of interest as to what
    they would do at night.  At sunset a gun was fired from the Admiralâs
    ship, at the sound of which, as if by magic, the flags dropped from
    the stern of every vessel at the same instant, though the topyards
    did not go down as was expected.  That was about half-past eight
    oâclock, and at nine bang went another gun from the Admiralâs ship
    followed by the rattle of musketry on board the others, and seamen
    said, âThereâs the old Admiral a-fallen down the main hatchway,â that
    being the correct nautical form of indicating that the hands were
    ordered to âturn in.â  At about the same time lights were shown in
    front and at the sterns of the ships, producing a brilliant and
    lively spectacle, taken in conjunction with the hundreds of lights on
    small craft lying at anchor, and as shown by the screw colliers which
    were ever and anon passing through the fleet and flowing out dark
    volumes of smoke.  With Saturday Mr. Swannâs contract to supply beef
    at 4Â½d. per lb., luckily for him, expired, and he agreed, we believe,
    to execute the orders of the fleet at 6Â½d.

    Sunday morning, as had been anticipated by the Yarmouth innkeepers
    and others, brought an immense number of people into the town, the
    trains from Norwich being very lengthy.  The weather was fine, and as
    the fleet still remained in the Roads, there was every prospect of
    enjoyment.  As the excursionists came into the town they proceeded,
    after refreshing the inner man at the earliest opportunity, either to
    the beach or on board the three steamers of Fill and Co. (Chesapeake,
    Volunteer and Florence Nightingale), which were ready, as soon as
    filled, to start for a journey round the fleet.  The Chesapeake was
    the first to start, and as she steamed down the harbour the
    excursionists had a good view of the quays and shipping, and also of
    the hamlet of Gorleston.  As soon as the bar was crossed, the great
    ships were all plainly visible, their sides bristling with guns, and
    alive with seamen, who, on the visitors approaching, exchanged a few
    friendly shouts with them.  From the middle of the two lines in which
    they were moored, the ships had a noble and awe-inspiring effect upon
    those who had not before seen such wonders of the seaâthey were, in
    fact, so many towers of strength filled with dauntless warriors.  The
    Mersey, the smartest, the swiftest, and most powerful frigate of the
    fleet, was greatly admired, as was also the Royal Albert, and many
    thoughtâ

    âHow proud must be our Admiral
    Of such a bonny barque.â

    Officers and men were at nearly all parts of the ship, and cordially
    invited the excursionists to go on board, an offer which the steamer
    declined, out of regard to the safety of the passengers.  Small
    pleasure boats from the beach, however, were running to the fleet in
    large numbers, cutting and plunging through the sea that might have
    made some persons timid.  The steamers disembarked their freight at
    the Britannia Pier (which found Sunday the most prosperous day of its
    existence) and continued throughout the day to run to and from that
    Pier without intermission.  Indeed, in the afternoon the Britannia
    Pier, which was crowded almost from end to end, presented a
    remarkable spectacle.  The beef, potatoes, and greens for the fleet
    were brought to the pier-head in carts, and were stacked for
    conveyance to the ships in the shipsâ boats.  The sailors, amongst
    whom was the usual per centage of black fellows, tossed the beef and
    cabbages into the boats in a manner not at all ceremonious, and one
    quarter to a certainty, though some say three or four, was pitched
    into Davey Jonesâs locker.  This scene of conveying away the carcases
    of about 60 bullocks (so the number was stated, though we think over
    the mark), of a few sheep, and goodness only knows how many cabbages
    and loaves, was very interesting to the public, and kept the pier
    crowded with spectators till six or seven oâclock.  There was in the
    afternoon and evening the largest assemblage of people on the parade
    and beach that the oldest inhabitant remembers to have seen in the
    town, and it was not till a late hour that the last disappeared.  The
    effect of so many strangers being in the town was to effect an entire
    demolition of most of the eatable stores in the hands of the
    innkeepers; and it is sufficient to say that a great thirst
    prevailed.  The Jacks and officers who were ashore in some force in
    the afternoon preferred wandering into the town and outskirts; and
    the former, who as a rule were shoeless, seemed to pick up a good
    deal of fun.  Besides the usual mode of conveyance of pouring in
    visitors, we observed several original vehicles from the country
    arrive in the afternoon, laden to excess and to the evident
    inconvenience of the passengers.  The day passed off so well that the
    majority of the inhabitants retired, hoping, we have no doubt, that
    the Channel Fleet might remain a week.  Sinister rumours, however,
    were at work, and some fears were secretly entertained.  Great bags
    of letters had been taken from and sent to the Post Office, and
    report was that despatches had been received ordering the fleet off
    to Spithead at once.

    When the general bulk of the population awoke on Monday morning,
    alas! the fleetâwith the exception of the Mars, which had lost an
    anchor and was waiting to endeavour to regain itâwere off!  They left
    us between five and six oâclock; and many have a firm opinion that
    the Mars was detained by some Providential influence, so that the
    thousands of excursionists who came in on Monday, in the hope of
    seeing the Channel Fleet, might not be utterly disappointed.  May a
    British Fleet honour us again with its presence, at the earliest
    opportunity.

                                                          âGreat Yarmouth,
                                                         âNov. 29th, 1860.

    âDear Sir,âUpon full enquiry, I find that the statements made by me
    in a speech at the dinner at the Theatre in April last, and
    complained of by you as reflecting on yourself as a member of the
    committee therein referred to, were made under an erroneous
    impression of the facts of the case, as far as yourself and the
    committee are concerned.

    âUnder these circumstances, I have no hesitation in withdrawing the
    imputations you and the committee complain of, and the plea of
    justification, and in expressing my regret that legal proceedings
    were deemed necessary, which, being now ended, no difference will, I
    trust, henceforth be made in the friendly feeling that has previously
    existed between us.

                                                             âYours truly,
                                                       âEDM. H. K. LACON.â

    W. T. Clarke, Esq.â

At the Police Court, Mr. Owles again called attention to the âpracticalâ
joking question, when Sergeant Barnes stated that the jokers âwere
attired in cloaks, and one wore a uniform cap.â

Dec. 29th.âThe Rifle Corps, 180 strong, had marched to Hopton, where
Major Orde âregaled them on bread and cheese, hot sausage rolls, and
plenty of old ale.â

At the Parish Audit, the Auditor remarked that âin some instances the
amount (of the rate) excused exceeded the sum collected.â

May 17th.âThe following appears as to the Corporate Robes of Office:â

                            âTHE ROBES OF OFFICE.â

    The Committee as to the Wearing of Robes of Office reported that Mr.
    C. J. Palmer, had liberally presented to the Council a scarlet silk
    gown, and a black gown formerly worn by the Mayors as their Robes of
    Office; and the said were accepted by the Committee, and the thanks
    of the Committee were voted to Mr. Palmer for the _handsome_
    donation.  The Committee had resolved that the Mayor should wear the
    black gown as a Robe of Office on all âOrdinaryâ occasions and the
    scarlet gown on all âextraordinaryâ occasions.

    The âRobesâ or âGownâ movement, which was so much spoken of six
    months ago, has at lengthâthrough the exertions of the Committee to
    whom it was referredâcome to maturity, and the Mayor now has a second
    hand best gown for âextraordinaryâ occasions, and a second-hand
    second best gown for âordinaryâ occasions.  The old people about Gaol
    Street, who caught a sight of the Mayor in his gown on Tuesday last,
    look upon the revived _costume_ as a âdegenerate resurrection;â for,
    instead of there being completeness and congruity in the âfit out,â
    there is a burlesque mixture of the ancient and modern.  The gown
    which erst harmonised with the glorious cocked hat, short tights, and
    silver buckled shoes, appears decidedly âat seaâ in company with the
    modern hat (or â4s. and 9d.â) and âpeg-topâ trousers.  Art critics
    would object to so close a mixture of the mediÃ¦val and the modern, on
    the ground of the same not being âin keeping.â  Perhaps, however,
    when we see the style of dress on one of the âextraordinaryâ
    occasions so judiciously and so elaborately provided for by the
    Council, we may have something presented to notice which will not
    cause every Councillor to grin on beholding it, and to talk, as an
    old writer says, âmost consumedlyâ about it afterwards.  Dressed as
    he was on Tuesday, the Mayor of Yarmouth might, without difficulty,
    have been mistaken (had he been away from home) for Shylock, for one
    of the Japanese Embassy, or for an Arch Druid, so remarkably unusual
    was his appearance.  Experience may, it is true, tone down the
    angularities of the affair; but at the onset the revival of the use
    of robes does not carry with it either the appearance of gravity or
    wisdom.  On entering the Council Room on Tuesday, the Mayor was
    preceded by four officials wearing, in addition to the ordinary
    attire of various colours, gowns, and carrying the sword and two
    maces as usual, with, on this occasion, the very handsome oarâa part
    of the regalia which had, for some very âextraordinaryâ reason no
    doubt, been disused.  Following the officers were the Mayor, who wore
    in addition to his every day clothing a black robe, of somewhat
    fierce cut, having a sort of fur or bear skin epulet at each
    shoulder, ornamented with a description of rough filagree; and over
    this finery his worship wore (we believe for the first time) the gold
    chain of office.  After the Mayor, entered the Town Clerk in a black
    robe of a more modest character.  For some little time there was much
    winking and smiling amongst the Aldermen and Councillors.  The
    business then proceeded, and, as will be seen from our report of the
    meeting, arrangements were made (in spite of Mr. Richard Ferrierâs
    âchaffingâ) for the order of processions.  It was also decided to
    give the Town Hall and the inhabitants the benefit of a public clock,
    of which the Corporation are owners.  It was also jocularly suggested
    that the Gas Company would be most willing gratuitously to illuminate
    the dial, and through it the inhabitants.

May 21st.âThere had been an âUproarious Vestry Meeting,â held for the
object of passing a vote of censure on the Vestry Clerk; Mr. S. C Marsh
presided, and in the result, the meeting being in favour of the Vestry
Clerk, a poll was demanded.

May 29th.âThis poll had, after a protest by Mr. J. Clowes as to the
regularity of the proceedings, been taken by Mr. C. Diver (acting as
Assessor).  It closed on the first dayâ

For the Vestry Clerk             143
Against him                       61
                  Majority        82

And next morning Mr. Marsh attended and declared the poll closed.

May 28th.âFive vessels of war (part of the Channel fleet) were in the
Roads.

May 31st.âThe following ships were anchored abreast of the
Jetty:ââTrafalgarâ (86), Captain Dickson; the âRevengeâ (91), Captain
Fellowes; the âEmeraldâ (51), Captain Caning; the âChanticleerâ (17),
Captain Sterling; and the âPorpoiseâ (tender to the âRevenge.â)

June 4th.âThis issue contains the following account of

                    âTHE CHANNEL FLEET AND PRINCE ALFRED.â

    For several days after Wednesday last, a number of persons in this
    town were almost in a fever of expectation as to the arrival of
    Prince Alfred, in the âSt. George;â and in spite of official
    intimation that the Prince is to be considered on business when with
    the fleet, and, as a consequence, exempt from municipal honours and
    popular demonstrations, it was determined to make the most of him
    here.  The forerunners of the âSt. Georgeâ were boarded and teased by
    all sorts of enquiries; bills were posted about with the words âthe
    arrival of Prince Alfredâ upon them, and all imaginable measures
    taken to get up excitement.  All, however, failed to draw a large
    number of strangers to the town; and we do not exceed the fact when
    we say that the visit of the Channel Squadron for a much briefer
    period in 1860, brought to the town ten times the number of strangers
    who have come on this occasion.  The Mayor of Yarmouth, soon after
    the fleet arrived, offered to give the officers a dinner if they
    would accept the invitation; but it was declined.  A ball was then
    offered to be got up, and it was promised that such of the officers
    as could attend would do so if the ships still remained in the Roads
    and provided it were got up for the earliest possible dayâMonday.  A
    ball was, therefore, decided on for that evening.  But some
    uneasiness was felt as to the non-arrival of the âSt. Georgeâ with
    Prince Alfred; and when, on Saturday, the ship did not appear, it
    began to be feared that she would not come, and the people consoled
    themselves with such information as that the Admiralâa jolly tarâhad
    amused himself by playing a game of bowls at the Vauxhall Green, &c.
    Although Admiral Smart and the officers declined to dine with the
    Mayor on shore, they invited his worship and other gentlemen to dine
    with them afloat, which the Mayor accepted for Saturday night.  On
    Sunday morning the âSt. Georgeâ came quietly into the Roads through
    the Cockle Gat, and anchored at the northern end of the line of
    ships, abreast of the town, at about half-past eight oâclock.  It was
    reported for some time that the ship which had just arrived was the
    âDonegal,â but as it became known that it really was the âSt.
    George,â flags were run up in all directions, and persons went to
    work with their spy glasses, apparently hoping to catch a sight of
    the Prince.  The steamtugs, which ran as passenger boats round the
    fleet, at once got better freights, and many who took trips in them
    returned under the impression that they had seen the Prince in the
    maintop of the âSt. George.â  Others would have it that the Prince
    was one of the young officers who was ashore on Sunday afternoon,
    walking leisurely up and down the drive and elsewhere; this turned
    out to be correct.  But as the Prince was, happily for him, not
    recognised whilst ashore, he walked about unmolested.  Few persons
    believed that so large a ship as the âSt. Georgeâ (Captain Egerton)
    would venture to enter the Roads through the Cockle, but to the
    surprise of many local nautical authorities she sailed through as
    cleanly as any fishing cutter, and dropped anchor in as familiar a
    manner as might have been expected from an old visitant of these
    waters.  Soon after she had anchored the âSt. Georgeâ was boarded by
    Mr. Watson, secretary of the Sailorsâ Home, who brought off messages
    and letters.  Prince Alfred went on shore, _incognito_, in the
    afternoon, as did also a large number of other midshipmen and older
    officers.  On Monday morning, the town authorities, and sightseers
    generally, were on the alertâall being in search of the Prince.  But
    again, as few individuals had a personal knowledge of his Royal
    Highness, he escaped without recognition, and with Major Cowell (and,
    we believe, other gentlemen) he drove out into the country.  As to
    this and other proceedings of the Prince during the day, there were
    scores of different reports; but we believe we are correct in saying
    that, after his trip inland, His Royal Highness went from the Beach,
    in the boat of which he is midshipman, on board the âSt. George.â  On
    board the ship the Mayor and Town Clerk were, we understand,
    introduced to the Prince, and courteously received.  Between two and
    three oâclock p.m., the Prince, Admiral Smart, Major Cowell, and the
    Hon. Manners Sutton (with whom the Prince had consented to partake of
    luncheon, at Kimberley Terrace), came on shore, accompanied in the
    boat by the Mayor and Town Clerk.  His Royal Highness, the Hon.
    Manners Sutton, and Major Cowell, then walked down to the Cricket
    Ground at the South Denes, where a party of officers from the fleet
    were playing a game of cricket with the members of the Yarmouth Club.
    It had been reported that the Prince would visit the Cricket Ground,
    and the consequence was that a large number of persons (probably
    2,000) congregated there about two oâclock, over and above those
    individuals who had been previously attracted to the spot by the
    match itself, and by the two bandsâone from the fleet, and that of
    the East Norfolk Militia.  As soon as His Royal Highness was
    recognised upon the ground, the crowd rapidly closed in around him,
    and had it not been for the protection afforded him by the two
    gentlemen by whom he was accompanied, he would in all likelihood have
    undergone an unpleasant jostling.  So pressing and eager did the
    inquisitive public become that in a few minutes the Royal sailor and
    Mr. Sutton commenced a retrograde movement, whereupon the people
    began running and pushing franticallyâgoing in some instances as the
    saying hath it, âhead over heels.â  Remarks such as âThat is he!â
    with comments upon the Princeâs personal appearance, were loud and
    frequent; and much surprise appeared to be felt that the âDuke of
    Yorkâ should go abroad in the ordinary unassuming attire of a
    midshipman.  Some faint attempts at cheering were assayed, but the
    clamour of the âhuntâ which was got up, overpowered everything but
    the dust.  The Prince took all this good humouredly, and with his two
    protectors walked sharply on to Kimberley Terrace, pursued all the
    way up the drive by an immense crowd.  Most of the persons going
    southward, and who met the crowd, had no idea what all the row was
    about until they were told.  His Royal Highness got safely to Mr.
    Suttonâs house, and in two or three minutes there was in front of the
    house, close from the area railing to the coping-stones of the drive
    on the eastward, a dense assemblage, which continued to increase up
    to five oâclock, when we observed it still standing there.

    Lunch over, the Prince, a little after five oâclock, escaped from the
    back door, unobserved by the crowd, and was enabled to stroll into
    the town.  He went up St. Georgeâs Road, through King Street, down
    Regent Street, and along the Quay, but did not venture into the
    Market Row.  He then visited Mrs. Onslow, who son is chaplain on
    board the âSt. George,â and, we believe, a tutor of the Prince.

    The cricket match terminated in favour of the naval men, who had, we
    hear, 69 runs to spare.  In the first innings the Yarmouth players
    had the best of it, but in the second the bowling of Midshipman
    Lawson made sad havoc among the batsmen.

    The Ball at the Town Hall was well attended, and went off with great
    _Ã©clat_.  The Prince, of course, was not present; but in the course
    of the evening Admiral Smart and a party of naval officersâwho were
    brought up to the Quay-side, opposite the Hall, in the âPorpoiseâ
    gunboatâjoined the assembly and remained until after midnight.

    The number of visitors to the ships increased considerably on Tuesday
    (this) morning, when it became known that an order had been received
    for the ships to hold themselves in readiness for sailing next day.

    Altogether the visit of the fleet on this occasion has been a
    brilliant affair; and the public have had ample time to inspect the
    ships, some of which might much oftener, with advantage, find a berth
    in Yarmouth Roads.

    The town has not, we believe, been visited by a Royal personage since
    the time that Prince William (afterwards King) and the Princess
    Adelaide landed here, and remained for the night at the Angel Hotel.

June 7th.âAt the Channel Fleet Ball among those present were the Mayor,
the Town Clerk, Sir E. Lacon, M.P., Admiral Smart, Captain Fellowes,
R.N., Captain Egerton, R.N., Lieutenant the Hon. F. Gordon, Mr. and Miss
I. Preston, Lord W. Kerr and other naval officers, Mr. and Mrs. E. H. L.
Preston, Mr. and Mrs. C. C. Aldred, Misses Cubitt, Mr. A. and Misses
Steward, &c.  Next day a large number of persons visited the fleet, and
dancing took place on the shipsâ decks.

Colonel Ibetson had inspected the Rifle Volunteers on the Denes.

The âInoâ (a pleasure boat) had capsized when alongside the âSt. George,â
but all the people in her were saved.

June 11th.âAt the Vestry Meeting, the âSmall Tenements Actâ was proposed
to be applied to the parish.

Several houses and men had been struck by lightning during a
thunderstorm.

June 14th.âThe programme for the Volunteer Review had been published; it
was expected that 3,324 men would take part in it.

June 18th.âThe Dinner to the Volunteers on this occasion was to take
place on St. Georgeâs Denes; there were to be 17 tables, and the dining
room to cover 7,550 feet of ground.  One quart of beer per man had been
offered by Sir E. Lacon to the Volunteers.

June 21st.âThe Review had taken place and proved a great success: there
were 3,324 men actually on the Denes.  At the Dinner held on St. Georgeâs
Denes, the Mayor presided, and after giving the toasts of âThe Queenâ and
âThe Royal Family,â he gave âThe Army, Navy, and Militia,â to which
Colonel Grey, C.B., Captain Lacon, R.N., and Colonel Adair responded.
The Mayor then gave âThe Volunteers,â to which Colonel Brett replied, and
âThe Lord Lieutenants of Norfolk and Suffolk,â which was acknowledged by
Lord Suffield (Vice-Lieutenant of Norfolk) and Colonel Adair.  The Mayor
then gave âThe High Sheriff,â who responded.  The Mayor then gave âThe
Lord High Steward,â responded to by Lord Sondes, and âThe health of
Colonel Grey,â to which that officer replied; also âThe Brigadiers of the
Day,â replied to by Colonels Custance, Sir E. Lacon, and Astley.  The
High Sheriff then proposed âThe Mayor,â to which his Worship responded,
and the healths of the Rev. H. Nevill, of the Noblemen and Gentlemen âwho
had honoured us with their presence,â of âMr. Charles J. Palmerâ and âThe
Ladiesâ were also given and responded to.  It was considered that âThe
Mayor and gentlemen who formed the Committee of Management, and
particularly Mr. Charles J. Palmer, well deserved the thanks of the
public and the Volunteers.â

June 28th.âMajor Marsh (of the artillery) had resigned his commission.

July 2nd.âIt was stated that Major Marsh would be succeeded in his
command by Capt. John Lee Barber of the 1st Company, but Mr. Trafford was
stated to have also resigned, and it was rumoured that the Artillery was
likely to be amalgamated with the Rifle Corps.

July 9th.âThe Midsummer herring voyage was a failure.  Some attributed
this to the 130 smacks then fishing from the port, and others to the
early catches of immature fish.

July 12th.ââBlondinâ had been performing at the Victoria Gardens.

July 16th.âCommissioner Cane had been holding an inquiry at the Workhouse
to âascertain the nature of the duties of the various public officers and
method of their discharge.â

Victoria,â and the âGlanceâ competed, and the former won.  The âWandererâ
(Mr. J. L. Barber) won the River Yachtsâ match, and the âVolunteerâ the
small Yawl match.

Aug. 6th.âContains the following notice of âThe Water Frolic:âThis event,
which was formerly important from the fact of the ânewâ Mayor being then
chosen, and the official barge of the Mayor and Corporation being
present, came off on Monday afternoon, at that part of the Waveney
opposite Burgh Castle.  No official patronage was given to the affair,
and consequently it was not, municipally, of any weight.  But as the
weather was fine and sunny, with a âspankingâ southerly breeze, the
yachts, which had arranged to attend and compete in two races, were sure
of good sport, and the large crowds of persons who assembled early in the
day on the North Quay, augured well for the steamboats which Mr. Fillâa
worthy man of enterpriseâalways offers for the accommodation of the
public (pay or not pay) either for trips to Cromer and Southwold, or even
to Rotterdam fair, an event which East Anglians of old were wont to
delight in.  At Burgh there was a large assemblage of craftâwherries,
shipsâ boats, punts, yachts, and, in fact, anything that would safely
float.  Two matches were announced to take place, each for a stake value
at Â£10, and the ordinary river yachts were the competitors, with the
exception of the new and mischievous-looking boat of the High Sheriff of
Norfolkâa boat which, although it could not out-run Mr. Barberâs âFlying
Wanderer,â will yet do credit to her build.  The âpublic-house wherries,â
the pie stalls, the acrobats, and the rest of the contributors to the
dayâs fun were all active and appeared to do a good business.  The
yachting competitionâwhich the public ought to have considered the best
business of the dayâbegan with a match for Â£10, in which five
cutter-rigged yachts sailed, viz., Mr. Barberâs âWanderer,â Mr.
Nightingaleâs âRed Rover,â Mr. Readâs âBelvidere,â Mr. R. J. H. Harveyâs
âLady in White,â and Mr. Morganâs âBittern.â  The Wanderer had the
advantage throughout, and wonâalthough she was occasionally closely
pressed by the Red Rover.  The match extended over four rounds.  In the
second match for a similar stake by latteens the âVampireâ (Mr. Everett),
the âEnchantressâ (Mr. Green), and the âMerlinâ (Mr. Humfrey) started,
and continued in the order named to the close.  The âfrolicersâ then
commenced their homeward journey, and in the midst of music and song all
arrived safely, we believe, at the Bridge Foot, after spending a
convivial, if not a dignified, half day on the stream.  The frolic,
however, in the absence of official support, is shorn of its ancient
splendour.â

August 13th.âThe âOrder of Precedence of the members of the Councilâ had
been printed.  The Mayor had requested the members of that body to
accompany him to church on Sundays, Good Friday, and Christmas Day.

Mr. S. Nightingale had backed his âRed Roverâ against Mr. Barberâs
âWandererâ for four matches at Â£50 aside.

Thieves had âdrank the Sacramental wine and robbed the Poorâs boxâ at the
Independent Chapel, Gorleston.

August 16th.âAt the Races, none of the Stewards (who were Lord W.
Powlett, Count Batthyany, and Sir H. J. Stracey, Bart., M.P.,) had
attended, and the usual Ball at the Town Hall had not been held through
lack of patronage.

August 20th.âThe Yarmouth Cricket Club had played the âVisitors.â  The
score was:âFirst Innings: Yarmouth, 29; Visitors, 15.  Second Innings:

understood that Sir H. Stracey would offer himself again as a candidate
for the Borough, and that Mr. Watkin was pledged to come forward again in
the Liberal interest.

The Council had determined to place an illuminated clock on the Town
Hall.

The Southtown Barracks had been repaired at considerable expense.

Sept. 6th.âAt the rifle prize shooting, Colour-Sergeant Chipperfield had
taken the ladiesâ challenge cup from Sergeant Fenner by one point.
Corporal Denew had won the Chief Officersâ prize, and Sergeant Dick the
Borough Membersâ prize.

Sept. 10th.âThis shooting had been continued, and prizes won by Sergeant
Pearson, Sergeant Swann, and Volunteer Barrett.

Sept. 17th.âThe High Sheriff of Norfolk had given a grand Volunteer
Review and FÃªte at Crown Point, the Norfolk Artillery (Norwich and
Yarmouth), mustered on the field 7 Officers, 42 Non-Commissioned
Officers, 105 Gunners, and 23 Band, total 178; the Yarmouth Rifles (4
Companies) were 235 strong, viz., one field Officer, 4 Captains, 8
Subalterns, 5 Staff, 12 Sergeants, 4 Drummers, 185 rank and file, and 16
Band.

In the afternoon, the Volunteers and some 2,000 guests were entertained
at dinner in marquees erected for the purpose, and various amusements
provided.  The following Yarmouth names appear in the list of the
competitors for the prizes:âMajor Orde, Lieut. C. Diver, and Privates

the proxies had been worked against him.â

In the evening âthe illuminations were on a most extensive scale,
scarcely a house without a transparency or device.  The designs on the
Town Hall and Hospital School were very beautiful, while many others on
private houses were greatly admired.  On the Town Hall, facing the north,
was fixed the principal illumination, consisting of a magnificent plume
of feathers, having the letters âA. A.â on either side, and partly
encircled with a wreath of oak leaves and acorns.  The height of the
design was 18 feet by 30 feet in width, and was drawn by Mr. Morant, Town
Surveyor, and manufactured by Mr. Doughty, of Gaol Street.  The fireworks
were continued to a late hour, and we are happy to record that,
notwithstanding the pressure of the crowd, no accident occurred to mar
the pleasure of the day.  The arrangements of the police throughout were
most satisfactory, and to the credit of our townsmen it must be stated
that at the Police Court the following morning, the magistratesâ business
was finished in two minutes and a half, the only charge being a case of
drunkenness, which was graciously forgiven.  The ball at the Town Hall
was fashionably and numerously attended and dancing was kept up to the
music of Hulleyâs quadrille band with unflagging spirit until an early
hour the following morning.  During the day the inmates of the Workhouse
and Gaol were regaled, the former at the expense of the Guardians, and
the latter by the Mayor.  The inmates of the Fishermenâs Hospital were
also regaled with plum pudding and roast beef, each man having, in
addition, a pipe of tobacco, with a liberal supply of stout.  The women
also partook of tea, with a plentiful supply of cake.  The inmates
expressed themselves deeply grateful to the trustees of the charity for
thus enabling them to participate in the festivities of the day.â

W. Rivett              145

And an amusing scene had taken place at the close of the poll between the
Mayor and Mr. Rivett, the latter taunting his Worship for not coming up
in time to record his vote, and âvowing in not the most correct English a
fearful retaliation when his Worshipâs term of office should expire.â

by her crew, much to the disgust of her owner, Mr. J. Tomlinson, junr.,

July 18th.âThe Channel Fleet, consisting of the following ships (under

71 guns, 800 men, 600 horse-power, Captain Church; âEmeraldâ (frigate),
35 guns, 510 men, 600 horse-power, Captain Cummings; âLiverpool,â 39
guns, 540 men, 600 horse-power, Captain Lambert; âBlack Princeâ (armour
plated), 40 guns, 726 men, 1,200 horse-power, Captain Wainwright; âRoyal
Oak,â 35 guns, 547 men, 800 horse-power, Captain Campbell; âResistance,â

guns, 706 men, 1,200 horse-power, Captain Cochrane; âDefence,â 16 guns,
468 men, 600 horse-power, Captain Phillimore; âTrinculo,â (tender), 2
guns, 20 men.  It was nearly dark by the time the last vessel of the
squadron took up her moorings; numbers of persons, nevertheless, remained
on the Beach to a late hour, watching the lights displayed by the vessels
as they laid at their anchorage.

At eight oâclock on Wednesday morning, a salute of eleven guns was fired
from the Admiralâs ship, in acknowledgment of the salute by the
Volunteers the previous evening.  During the whole of Wednesday the fleet
was inspected by large numbers of visitors, who left the Britannia Pier
in steamers plying to and from the squadron at reasonable fares, while
the pier itself was the resort of many interested in watching the
constant arrival and departure of men-of-war boats, freighted with
provisions and stores, or in bringing officers on shore on leave.  At one
oâclock, the Mayor, and a party on board, left the bridge in the
steamboat âEmperor,â to pay an official visit to the Admiral.  The Mayor
was accompanied on the occasion by C. J. Palmer, W. Nightingale, C. C.
Aldred, W. Holt, G. S. Shingles, W. T. Foreman, W. Johnson, J. Clarke, B.
Fenn, E. P. Youell, W. Laws, J. H. Orde, J. Stephenson, and J. Bunn,
Esqs.  On arriving at the flag-ship the party were most courteously
received by Captain Hornby, in the absence of the Admiral, who,
unfortunately, was on shore.  After remaining a short time inspecting the
âEdgar,â the party proceeded to the âWarrior,â where they were received
by the Hon. Captain Cochrane, who escorted them over the ship.  This was
by far the most interesting feature of the excursion the powerful
armament and splendid construction of this truly noble vessel exciting
the admiration of all.  The crew, numbering upwards of 700, were all
found busily engaged at their varied avocations, some intent upon their
drill at the huge Armstrong guns, while others were pursuing more
peaceful avocations.  The interior arrangements of the âWarrior,â as a
ship of war, have been so frequently and fully described, that it is
unnecessary to allude further to them, suffice it to say that, after
viewing all parts of the vessel, one could but feel that England had but
little to fear from foreign invasion, while guarded by such bulwarks of
defence.  The Mayor, with his friends, having made the tour of the fleet,
returned to the Britannia Pier and disembarked.  The Mayor then proceeded
to the Victoria Hotel, where the Admiral was understood to be staying,
but was again unsuccessful in having an interview with him, as he had
just previously left to go on board his flag-ship.  Under these
circumstances, the Mayor addressed a letter to the gallant officer,
expressing his regret at not meeting him, and tendering on behalf of the
town an invitation to himself and officers to attend a ball at the Town
Hall, on Monday evening, expressing a hope that his arrangements would
enable him to accept it.â

The Fleet were, however, compelled to leave on the Sunday afternoon.

Norfolk as well as the Borough, and also filled the office of Haven
Commissioner.  Mr. Palmer throughout his long connection with the town
was closely identified with the trade and commerce of the port, being a
large shipowner, and deeply interested in the fisheries.  His loss will
be felt by many, particularly among the poor, to whom he was a true
friend.  As a tribute of respect to his memory, the flags have been

The polling took place on the following day, and this description is
given of

                               âTHE ELECTION.â

    The very general expectation that prevailed as to the severity of the
    contest drew early together large numbers of persons, who thronged
    the vicinity of the polling places and the streets throughout the
    day.  The polling from eight to nine oâclock was very rapid, both
    parties striving their utmost to bring up men so as to head the poll.
    The popular feeling, which manifested itself unmistakeably in favour
    of the Liberal cause, was sadly damped between the hours of nine and
    ten oâclock by the appearance of a placard bearing the state of the
    poll, and showing that the Conservatives, notwithstanding the
    activity displayed by the other side, had stolen a march upon them,
    and meant winning.  The result of the next hourâs polling had
    considerably increased the Conservative majority, and, as a large
    proportion of the electors had voted, it became evident that the
    battle, as far as Liberal interests were concerned, was all but lost.
    As the day advanced, the position of the Liberals on the poll became
    worse, and all chance of retrieving their position was hopeless.  The
    excitement was very great in the town, but the crowd continued to
    conduct themselves pretty quietly, contenting themselves with venting
    their disappointment by groaning heartily at every vehicle bearing
    placards of âVote for Lacon and Goodson.â

    (failing to satisfy the Malt-tax Repeal party), Mr. Clare Sewell Read
    was proposed as a candidate for the Division, as also were Colonel
    Coke, Mr. Howes, and Sir Thomas; the show of hands being in favour of
    Howes and Read, a poll was demanded for the Whig candidates (the Hon.
    Colonel Clarence Wenman Walpole Coke and Sir Thomas Brograve
    Proctor-Beauchamp, Bart.,) who proceeded to Yarmouth, where their
    agent (Mr. F. Danby-Palmer) at once organised a meeting of 6,000

    Hotel, which was addressed by the Mayor (R. Steward, Esq.), Mr. C. S.

    the âcigar ship,â put into this harbour on Friday last, and has since
    continued to be an object of great curiosity among our seafaring
    population.  The vessel, which is named the âWalter S. Winans,â was
    built by the firm of Messrs. Winans, American contractors, and is
    stated to be on an experimental cruise, with the view of thoroughly
    testing her sea-going qualities.  She is fitted with a screw
    propeller, the fans of which are entirely submerged.  Her engines are
    of 35 horse power, but can be worked up to 50, and it is stated she
    has attained a speed of 14 miles an hour.  The peculiarity of her
    build gives her a singular appearance, her cone-shaped bow projecting
    for some distance clear of the water, while her stern is more
    depressed.  This gives her a very unsightly look, and it is evident

    being of an inferior character compared with other sea-going
    steamers.â

seconded, Mr. Edmond Robert Wodehouse; Mr. E. Fellowes, M.P., proposed,
and Mr. R. Leaman seconded, the Hon. Frederick Walpole; Mr. Bulwer
proposed, and Mr. Richard England seconded, Mr. Robert T. Gurdon; and the
High Sheriff (Lord Ranelagh) having declared the show of hands equally
divided between the candidates, a poll was demanded on behalf of all of
them.

Nov. 28th.âThe poll had been declared as under:â

Walpole              2,642
Lacon                2,574
Wodehouse            2,237
Gurdon               2,081

At Yarmouth it was stated that:â

    âthe proceedings throughout the day in connection with the polling
    for this part of the district were characterised by considerable
    excitement.  The Conservatives from the opening of the poll took a
    prominent position, and as hour by hour passed away their majority
    steadily increased, until by three oâclock they were, according to
    their published returns, nearly 400 ahead.  No statement of the poll
    was made during the day by the Liberals, but every exertion was made
    to reduce the Conservative majority.  Cabs and carriages bearing
    placards of âVote for Wodehouse and Gurdonâ were dashing about in all
    directions, keeping up the excitement; but, despite every effort, the
    influence of the local candidate proved too strong to be successfully
    resisted, and at four the Conservative declaration of numbers showed
    the following result:â

Lacon                948
Walpole              890
Wodehouse            505
Gurdon               469

    The polling at Ormesby for the Hundreds of East and West Flegg was
    also, as might have been anticipated, greatly in favour of the
    Conservative candidates.  Despite these adverse returns, the Liberal
    agents were sanguine of better results in other parts of the
    district, but their majorities at Cromer, Wells, and Holt, failed to
    make any material change, so far as the issue of the election was
    concerned, and it became at length apparent that the hopes of the
    Liberal majority in North Norfolk were at an end.  Notwithstanding
    the excitement engendered by the contest, the election was conducted
    throughout with great good humour.  During the day the streets and
    approaches to the polling places were thronged by persons who amused
    themselves by cheering and shouting in favour of their respective
    candidates, but there was, during the afternoon, an entire absence of
    the drunkenness and violence that characterised previous borough
    elections.  If the numbers polled be examined, it will be found that
    in the county (excluding Yarmouth) Mr. Wodehouse and Mr. Gurdon are
    in a slight majority.  It was in Yarmouth where the majority was
    obtained, and which, we hear, will yet be found to have been obtained
    by illegal practices.â

Dec. 12th.âMr. Nutman (Relieving Officer for the North District) had

Esq.:ââWe regret to announce the death of Mr. R. Ferrier, who expired at
his residence, Trafalgar Road, on Sunday morning, after a protracted
illness.  The deceased gentleman represented St. Georgeâs Ward for many
years in the Town Council, though for some time past his ill health had
incapacitated him from the discharge of his public duties.  He was a man
of sound judgment and excellent business habits, and his opinion on all
practical matters had great weight with the Council.  Mr. Ferrier was in
politics a Conservative, and in his younger days was distinguished by the
zeal and energy with which, at all times, he worked for his party.  In

Hall.â

Nov. 5th.âOwing to the extension of the franchise and the âsplitâ in the
Conservative camp, the Municipal Election had excited a good deal of
attention, as the following report shows:â

                            âMUNICIPAL ELECTION.â

    As was expected, these elections were fought out with considerable
    spirit, the town throughout the day presenting all the aspects of a
    contested general election, cabs duly placarded with the names and
    claims of the candidates rushing about the streets in all directions
    _en route_ to the various polling-places or committee-rooms.

    In the North Ward the Conservatives were early at work, and were
    enabled to put their candidates considerably ahead, Messrs. Worship
    and Hilton counting a formidable majority at an early stage of the
    contest.  The friends of Messrs. Neave and Blyth were, however, far
    from dismayed, and worked with a degree of zeal that certainly
    deserved if it did not ensure success.  In the course of the
    afternoon the Conservative majority had been greatly reduced, and it
    looked at one time as if Mr. Neaveâs return would have been secured.
    The aspect of things nerved the Conservatives to renewed efforts and
    enabled them to keep ahead of their opponents, the result being the
    return of their candidates, Messrs. Worship and Hilton.

    In the Market Ward the greatest excitement prevailed, popular feeling
    being in favour of Mr. J. Norman (L) and Mr. I. Preston.  The latter,
    although a Conservative, came forward on independent grounds, and as
    opposed to the compromise that has been entered into for the return
    of Messrs. Norman and Combe.  The last-named gentleman was brought
    out under the auspices of that section of the Conservative party,
    better known as the âclique,â which evoked the determined opposition
    of the âindependentâ portion of the party.  There was another
    candidate in the person of Mr J. Garratt (L), but that gentleman
    retired at an early stage of the contest in favour of Mr. Combe.
    Soon after the commencement of the polling, it became evident that
    Mr. Normanâs election would be safe, and that the real fight would be
    between Messrs. Combe and Preston.  The last-named had a large staff
    of energetic supporters, and he was soon placed in a majority which
    no efforts on the part of his opponents could break down.  The
    result, therefore, in this ward was the return of Messrs. Norman and
    Preston, which must be regarded as a great blow to the dominant
    section of the Conservative party, who strained every nerve to carry
    their man.

    The contest in the Regent Ward was of diminished interest as compared
    with the other parts of the town, and resulted in the return of the
    Conservative candidates, Messrs. Barber and Tomlinson.  Against these
    gentlemen were arrayed Messrs. Woodger and Page; but the candidature
    of the two last-named was carried on in a sort of guerilla fashion
    that evinced little confidence in a successful result, and their
    respective chances will be found very fully illustrated in the
    returns given at the close of the poll.

    In the St. Georgeâs Ward the battle was between Messrs. Doughty and
    Baker, (C), and Messrs. Palmer and Hammond (L).  Here a most
    determined fight was made, the Liberals commencing the business of
    the day in a style that evidently meant winning.  Soon after the
    first hourâs polling, Messrs. Palmer and Hammond took a commanding
    lead, and although the utmost zeal was evinced on the part of their
    opponents, they kept increasing their majority until by noon it had
    assumed such proportions as to place the issue of the contest beyond
    all question.  The result was unexpected, and created quite a
    sensation among the Conservatives, who chagrined at the turn of
    affairs in the Market Ward, were little prepared for this fresh
    source of annoyance and discomfiture.

    In the Nelson Ward there was no contest, Messrs. Woolverton, (C), and
    Stone (L) being unopposed.

    The election in the Southtown or St. Andrewâs Ward was provocative of
    the usual excitement, the Gorlestonians coming out in considerable
    force, and testifying their Conservative or Liberal proclivities in
    the liveliest manner.  The candidates were Messrs. Steward and
    Hammond, (C), as opposed to Messrs. Beevor and Nelson.  The contest
    was well fought throughout, and resulted in the election of the
    Conservative candidates.

    In celebration of the victory in the St. Georgeâs Ward, the Liberals
    paraded a band, which did honour to the occasion by playing a
    selection of popular music through the principal streets.

                            OFFICIAL DECLARATION.

    The official swearing-in of the newly-elected members took place on
    Thursday afternoon, the proceedings creating more than their wonted
    interest from the expectation of a âscene.â  These anticipations were
    fully realised.  Previous to the commencement of the usual routine,
    Mr. J. F. Neave, one of the defeated Liberal candidates in the North
    Ward, addressed Mr. S. Nightingale, and, in a tone of considerable
    vehemence, charged that gentleman and his supporters with having
    secured the election by unfair practices by bringing forward
    individuals to personate voters who were dead or at sea, or by other
    means equally discreditable.  The scene which ensued was of the most
    lively character, some half-dozen Councillors speaking at once.
    Those in the body of the Court showed their enjoyment by encouraging
    shouts of âGo it Neave,â âGive it them,â an appeal, however, which
    was scarcely necessary, as the North Ward champion appeared in fine
    mettle, and continued his address, although the greater part of it
    was lost in the general turmoil.  Referring to the result, Mr.
    Nightingale was understood to say that Mr. Neave would never be so
    near winning again, which elicited a rejoinder from the latter that
    he had been told he should never be elected a Guardian, but he had
    shown them what he could do, and if he were spared he would yet be in
    the Council.  This declaration of future hostilities was received
    with great uproar, which was with difficulty quelled sufficiently to
    enable the business of the meeting to be proceeded with.  This having
    been brought to a termination, after sundry interruptions, the
    newly-elected hastily quitted the Court, the proceedings having
    afforded a singular exhibition of political amenities, from a
    Yarmouth point of view.

Feb. 8th.âContains the following account of the death of Robert Steward,
Esq.:â

    âWe regret to record the death of this gentleman who expired suddenly
    at his residence in Cambridge, on Saturday evening.  Mr. Steward for
    a number of years occupied a very prominent position in this borough,
    having filled the office of Chief Magistrate on five occasions.  He
    was until recently an active member of the Town Council, having
    represented the Southtown or St. Andrewâs Ward for a lengthened
    period, during which time he exhibited a warm interest in all that
    related to the welfare of the borough.  Mr. Steward was one of the
    first to associate himself with the Volunteer movement, and was ever
    ready with his purse to aid the cause.  It was the occasion of his
    fifth election to the Mayoralty that his fellow-townsmen determined
    to present him with a testimonial in recognition of his public
    services, and so heartily was the appeal responded to, that a sum was
    soon raised sufficient for the purchase of a handsome service of
    plate, which was publicly presented at the Town Hall.  Latterly Mr.
    Steward had been suffering from failing health, and had taken up his
    residence at Cambridge, but on all occasions when anything of public
    interest was under discussion he was at his accustomed post in the
    Town Council.  Mr. Steward was a Justice of the Peace for the
    Borough, and also for the County of Suffolk.  As a public man his
    loss will be much felt, for though occasionally overbearing and
    impetuous, his faults were overlooked in the thorough earnestness
    with which he applied himself to the promotion of those measures
    which he considered for the general good.  Out of respect the flags
    on the Town Hall and shipping have been hoisted half-mast.â

    Mr. John Cooper, on behalf of the Conservative candidates, who had
    met the previous night, announced his intention not to proceed with
    the scrutiny before the returning officer, who had no authority to
    call witnesses, but stated that the whole conduct of the election
    would be laid before the Poor Law Board with a view to a thorough
    enquiry being instituted.  The election had been conducted in a
    fraudulent manner.  Mr. Cooper, in support of his assertion,
    instanced the case of Hurr, one of the collectors, who, he alleged,
    had only returned 113 papers out of 300.  Names had also been put on
    various papers without authority, while the collector (Hurr) had
    taken his papers to the house of one of the candidates, where they
    were examined and sorted.  Another collector in the Liberal interest,
    named Norman, had been convicted and sentenced to twelve monthsâ
    imprisonment for robbery.  Mr. Cooper went on to say that in the
    Market Ward (Hurrâs district) upwards of twenty papers had never been
    called for, and he understood that there were upwards of 50 which had
    been signed by one person.  The election had been conducted in such
    an unfair and scandalous manner, that the Conservatives had resolved
    upon demanding a Poor Law enquiry.

    Mr. Livingston said it would be for Mr. Cooper and his friends to
    make good the allegations just made.  He hoped if there had been any
    irregularity it would be fully enquired into.

    Mr. J. A. Norman (who headed the poll for the Market Ward) supposed
    that Mr. Cooper had suspected the Liberals had been adopting the
    former tactics of their opponents, and had taken a leaf out of their
    book.  (Laughter.)

    Mr. Overend (another successful candidate for the Market Ward) denied
    that the papers had been sorted in the shop as alleged, and said the
    collector called for information.

    Mr. Cufaude (the Returning-officer) said the collector ought not to
    have done this, as it was most irregular and contrary to the
    instructions given to the collectors.  He then gave the return as
    above, and the proceedings closed.

    The result has caused considerable heart-burning among the
    Conservatives, who have so long held the sway in all matters
    pertaining to local administration, and they cannot be expected to
    view with equanimity the storming of one of their chief strongholds
    by the enemy.

with deep regret that we announce the death of this much respected
gentleman, who expired at his residence, Regent Road, on Saturday morning
last, after a rather lengthened illness.  Mr. Hammond during his long
career has occupied so prominent a position, and has ranked so high in
the opinion of all classes of his fellow-townsmen, that his death,
although regarded as imminent, created much sensation.  The deceased, who
was born in 1792, and was consequently at the time of his decease in his
79th year, was one of the oldest Magistrates of the borough, having been
called to the Bench in 1841.  During the long period that Mr. Hammond was
associated with the administration of justice he was remarkable for his
uprightness and thorough independence of character.  Wealthy, but yet
conspicuous for his unostentatious mode of life, he was at all times
accessible to those of his poorer fellow townsmen, many of whom were wont
to seek his counsel, and advice.  In the exercise of his magisterial
functions, he was ever disposed to temper justice with mercy, and in his
death there must be many who must feel that they have lost a true and
valued friend.  The deceased for many years occupied a leading position
as among the most prominent, forward, yet consistent members of the
Liberal party, and although he had of late ceased to take any active part
in political controversies, he was always deeply interested in everything
that pertained to the advancement of the cause which he had so greatly at
heart.  Mr. Hammond, who was largely connected at one time with the
fisheries, had also a considerable stake in the shipping of the port, and
accumulated a large property, the bulk of which will, doubtless, have
been bequeathed to his three nieces, as he was unmarried.  Out of respect
to the deceased, the flags on the Town Hall, public buildings, and
shipping have been hoisted half-mast, while many private families have
shown similar marks of regard to the memory of the deceased.â

The Guardians had decided to allow Nonconformist Ministers to visit at

schools, Â£19 19s. each.

The cost of taking the census had amounted to Â£110 15s.

June 3rd.âRecords the death of David A. Gourlay, Esq., as follows:ââWe
regret to record the death of this gentleman, who expired at his
residence on Wednesday, at the advanced age of 89 years.  During his long
connection with the town, Mr. Gourlay contrived to amass considerable
wealth, having been largely connected with the shipping interest of the
port.  The deceased was a much respected member of the Liberal party in
the borough, and in 1849 filled the office of Mayor.  He was also a
Magistrate, having been placed on the roll of Justices in 1858, and for
many years represented the Market Ward in the Town Council, which
position he only resigned last year.  Mr. Gourlay was of a singularly
quiet habit, devoting his entire time to business pursuits, which he
continued until advancing years and infirmities compelled retirement.
The deceased was deeply interested in the educational movements of the
town, and a few years since presented the magnificent donation of Â£1,000
towards the Wesleyan Schools.  As a mark of respect to his memory the
flags on the Town Hall and shipping have been hoisted half mast.  The
number of borough magistrates who have died since 1863 has now reached
15.â

Mr. Attwood declined to vote.  After the voting the following âsceneâ
took place between the Mayor and Mr. Harmer:â

    Mr. Harmer said he had come forward as a candidate, considering his
    long connection with the party entitled him to their support.  He
    could not let that opportunity pass without expressing his thanks to
    those gentleman who had accorded him their votes.  He could but think
    if the Mayor had fought a âmanly and open gameââ(cries of âno, no,â
    and uproar)âand postponed his canvassing from the Saturday to the
    Monday, he should have been in a very different position there that
    day.  (Renewed cheers and uproar.)  He believed he should have had
    most of those promises which the Mayor had obtained on the Sunday.
    (Cries of âno, no,â and general uproar.)  He felt certain that a
    great many of his friends in the Council whom he had known many
    years, and who had been induced to vote against him, were sorry for
    it, and had only been led to do so by the promise given the Mayor on
    Sunday.  (Cries and groans and general tumult in the gallery.)  He
    met an old friend the other day, and on asking him for his vote, he
    replied, âI am very sorry I cannot give it you, as I promised the
    Mayor on Sundayâ(cheers and laughter)âbut you have my sympathy, and I
    hope you may win.â  He (Mr. Harmer) could not help replying, âHang
    your sympathy; give me your vote.â

    The Mayor said he could not let Mr. Harmerâs remarks upon himself
    pass without comment.  Coming home quietly from church on the Sunday
    morning referred to following the mace-bearers, Mr. Harmer came up to
    him and canvassed him for the Clerkship of the Peace, Mr. Cufaude not
    being then dead.  (Hear, hear, and uproar.)  He told Mr. Harmer that
    Mr. Cufaude was not dead and (he might as well tell them all that
    passed), said he hoped to God he might live till after March, so that
    they (the Conservatives) might have the opportunity of fighting the
    Guardians.  (Cheers and counter cheers.)  In walking down to the
    Station-house he said to Mr. Harmer, if that should be the case, and
    they should get a majority at the Board of Guardians, Mr. Harmer
    could go in for the Clerk of the Guardians, and he (the Mayor) for
    the Clerk of the Peace,â(loud laughter)âand that they could work
    together.  Mr. Harmer replied by saying that he should go in for both
    appointmentsâ(cheers and laughter)âand he (the Mayor) replied that he
    could not do so, but if he (the Mayor) won one, he would support Mr.
    Harmer in the other, and if Mr. Harmer was successful in one, he
    could give him his help in trying to obtain the other appointment for
    his son.  (Hear, hear.)  In the afternoon of that day Mr. Cufaude
    died, and as he knew Mr. Harmer was canvassing, did they think he was
    such a fool as to let him outstep him.  (Cheers and uproar.)

    Mr. Harmer rose to reply, but the confusion became so great owing to
    the shouting and recrimination, backed up by the adherents of the
    respective parties in the gallery, that scarcely anything could be
    heard amid the din of words.  During a temporary lull in the storm,

    Mr. Harmer, who was still speaking excitedly, was understood to say
    that he did not go between the bark and the tree, but that he wished
    to tell the whole truth about the conversation between him and the
    Mayor.  He asked the Mayor how Mr. Cufaude was, and he replied that
    he was very bad indeed, and not expected to live.  (At this juncture
    of Mr. Harmerâs reply several of the Councillors vacated their seats,
    and left the room, and the disorder which had calmed down a little
    again broke out.  Mr. Harmer, thus interrupted, stopped in his
    speech, but in response to cries of âgo on, go on,â from the public,
    he turned himself to the gallery, and addressing the occupants of
    that place, continued his remarks.)  He said he observed to the
    MayorââIn case anything happens, what do you intend to do?â  The
    Mayor replied âIf my son comes forward I must support him,â to which
    he (Mr. Harmer) replied âvery naturally, too.â  He then told the
    Mayor that he should be a candidate for the Clerkship of the Peace,
    and as they walked down Regent-street the Mayor remarked to him, âIf
    we can only keep the poor fellow alive till after the next election
    of Guardians, then we must all put our hands into our pockets and
    turn them (the Liberals) out.â  (Cries of âShame,â âBribery,â and
    general uproar.)  The Mayor then said âI will propose that you shall
    be Clerk of the Peace and Isaac, Clerk of the Guardians.â  (Cheers
    and laughter.)  His answer to that generous proposition was, âI shall
    not stand that; I shall expect the better berth of the two.â
    (Renewed laughter, and cries of âGo in Harmer.â)  The Mayor said
    âWell, after all, perhaps Isaac would rather have the Clerkship of
    the Peace, as there is not much to do, and as he is going to be
    married, and will be very well off, he wonât want it.â  (Loud
    laughter.)

    Here the confusion became so great that nothing could be heard, and
    as by this time the majority of the Councillors had dispersed, the
    proceedings closed amid wild uproar.

his seat, Coltishall Manor (which was devised to him by his grandfather,
William Danby-Palmer, Esq.), on 11th May, 1873.  Mr. Kemp was for many
years an active County Magistrate; and in the earlier part of his life,
prior to leaving Yarmouth, took part, with his half-brother, Major Samuel
Charles Marsh, and other members of his family, in our local politics;
later on, however (although in the Commission of the Peace for our
borough) he rarely visited his native town.  Leaving no issue, he devised
his estates to his cousin, George William Danby-Palmer, Esq. (who
subsequently assumed the name of Kerrison, under the provisions of the
will of the late Charles Kerrison, Esq.), and that gentleman still holds
the Coltishall property.
