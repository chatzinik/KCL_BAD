PREFACE.


THE object of the present work is to record the family particulars,
military and civil services, distinctions, public employments,
professional and commercial pursuits, and general personal information in
regard to that large section of the community who dwell at the âWest
End,â and in kindred localities.

Hitherto books of the same character have been restricted to the titled
and territorial classes; excluding as a rule those whom education and
intelligenceâtested by their professional and commercial pursuitsâhave
rendered equally deserving of honourable and gratifying mention, forming
as they do the bulk of what is termed good society.

To supply this deficiency is the intent of the present publication, which
aims, as already suggested, at being a handbook to the nobility and
gentry of Londonâthe term gentry being understood to include logically
those to whom the title of gentleman has been accorded by common
consentâthose as a rule whose vocation in life does not debar them from
admission to our West End Clubs.

To the work, as a whole, we have given the title of âARISTOCRACY OF
LONDON,â as a compliment in the first place to that titular and
hereditary element to which alone the word âAristocracyâ has been
hitherto assumed to belong, and next as a tribute to that other
intellectual and commercial element to which, in a wider sense, it may be
equally allowed to apply; as a homage, in short, to that eminence of rank
and that eminence of intelligence which, combined, impart their tone to
our educated classes, and necessarily to the reflex of these, the present
publication.

On the special interest which a work such as the âARISTOCRACY OF LONDONâ
must possess in the eyes of our oligarchic publicâto say nothing of its
indispensable utility to every person moving in societyâit is needless
here to dilate: the numerous personal books, peerage and other, which
have preceded it in popular estimation, constituting at once our reason
and apology for endeavouring to achieve comprehensively that which has
hitherto been attempted in fragments only.

For the sake of convenience the âARISTOCRACY OF LONDON,â will be divided
into eight parts, to be annually revised and corrected, namely:

1.âTHE ARISTOCRACY OF KENSINGTON.

2.âTHE ARISTOCRACY OF NOTTING HILL AND BAYSWATER.

3.âTHE ARISTOCRACY OF PADDINGTON AND ST. JOHNâS WOOD.

4.âTHE ARISTOCRACY OF PORTMAN, CAVENDISH, AND RUSSELL SQUARES, &c.

5.âTHE ARISTOCRACY OF HYDE PARK AND MAY FAIR.

6.âTHE ARISTOCRACY OF ST. JAMES AND BELGRAVIA.

7.âTHE ARISTOCRACY OF BROMPTON AND CHELSEA, &c.

8.âMISCELLANEOUS AND SUPPLEMENTARY.

The first of these parts, the âARISTOCRACY OF KENSINGTON,â is now
presented to the public.  While rendering the contents at once available
by a copious index to the nearly 800 notices which the body of the work
contains, we have adopted the novel and attractive plan of ranging the
information we have been able to acquire under the heads of the streets,
and according to the numbers or appellations therein of the houses at
which the various parties resideâthus at once illustrating the street and
the individual.  It must not, however, be assumed that those persons
whose names are not included in the following pages are therefore not
entitled to appear.  Omissions and errors, the results of deficiency of
information, are inseparable from a work of this character, especially in
the first issue.  Future editions will enable us to be more copious and
doubtless more accurate.  At the same time, we cannot deny that the work,
as it stands, contains the âcreamâ of those who dwell in the KENSINGTON
District, so far at least as we can judge from the numerous replies we
have received to our applications, showing a ready and courteous
disposition to communicate information on the part of those generally, it
is to be inferred, who had any to offer.  This friendly co-operation we
heartily and gratefully acknowledge, and we trust that those whom our
enquiries have accidentally not reached, will enable us to make the
_amende_ in our next edition.

It only remains for us to announce that the âARISTOCRACY OF LONDONâ will
be followed, in due course, by the âCOUNTY ARISTOCRACY,â in a series of
parts, each in itself complete, devoted to the âAristocracy of the
Empire.â

The Country Gentlemanâs London Agency.


                    _Annual SubscriptionâOne Guinea_.

The want has long been felt, by residents in the country, of a house in
London to represent their interests in those ever-recurring matters which
connect them with the metropolis.

Whether for the effecting of purchases, large or small, the receipt or
transmission of parcels, the receipt of interest and dividends, the
instituting of inquiries, or the general attention to requirements as
various as the occasions which produce themâthe country portion of the
public has hitherto been unable to utilise the resources of the British
capital, except through the often unpleasant alternative of troubling
friends, or of an expensive, and sometimes fruitless journey to town.

This general want the firm of Messrs. OâBYRNE supplies to its subscribers
at the simple charge of one guinea per annum.

For the payment, therefore, of this sum, made annually in advance, their
subscribers are entitled:â

1.  To have all their purchases effected, of a domestic or other
character, in the London market, at a cheaper rate, and of a better
quality, than can be done generally in the country.

2.  To a constant address, where all letters and parcels may be sent.

3.  To the supply of information on all subjects on which information can
be obtained.

4.  To the receipt of interest and dividends.

5.  To the effecting of sales and investments.

6.  To the procuring of passages to all foreign and colonial ports.

7.  To the supplying of outfits, &c.

8.  To the effecting of fire and life assurances, &c. &c.

                           Estimates provided.

                                                   OâBYRNE BROTHERS, & CO.

9, Adelphi Terrace, London, W.C.

Post-office orders to be made payable to Messrs. OâBYRNE, at the Charing
Cross Post-office, London.

CONSUMPTION IN ALL ITS STAGES.


   Coughs, Whooping Cough, Asthma, Bronchitis, Fever, Ague, Diptheria,
              Hysteria, Rheumatism, DiarrhÅa, Spasms, Colic,
    Renal, and Uterine Diseases are immediately relieved by a dose of

                                CHLORODYNE

                             (_Trade Mark_.)

                         DISCOVERED AND NAMED BY
                    Dr. J. COLLIS BROWNE, M.R.C.S.L.,
                          EX-ARMY MEDICAL STAFF.

                                * * * * *

The question asked by invalids, families, and households isâWhat is the
best medicine to give in the above diseases, and what to have always
ready?  Medical testimony, the reply of thousands of sufferers and
invalids, is confirmatory of the invaluable relief afforded by this
remedy above all others.

CHLORODYNE is a liquid taken in drops according to age.  It invariably
relieves pain of whatever kind; creates a calm refreshing sleep; allays
irritation of the nervous system when _all other remedies fail_; leaving
no bad effects like opium or laudanum, and can be taken when none other
can be tolerated.  Its value in saving life in infancy is not easily
estimated; a few drops will subdue the irritation of Teething, prevent
and arrest Convulsions, cure Whooping Cough, Spasms, and Flatus at
_once_.

Among Invalids it allays the pain of Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Gout, &c.  It
soothes the weary achings of Consumption, relives the Soreness of the
Chest, Cough, and Expectoration; and cures all Chest affections, such as
Asthma, Bronchitis, Palpitation, &c.  It checks DiarrhÅa, Alvine
Discharges, or Spasms and Colics of the Intestines, &c.

The extensive demand for this remedy, known as DR. J. COLLIS BROWNEâS
CHLORODYNE, by the Medical Profession, Hospitals, DispensariesâCivil,
Military, and Navalâand Families especially, guarantees that this
statement of its extreme importance and value is a _bona fide_ one, and
worthy the attention of all.

                      EXTRACTS OF MEDICAL OPINIONS.

From W. VESALIUS PETTIGREW, M.D.ââI have no hesitation in stating that I
have never met with any medicine so efficacious as an anti-spasmodic and
sedative.  I have used it in Consumption, Asthma, DiarrhÅa, and other
diseases, and am most perfectly satisfied with the results.â

From DR. MâMILLMAN, of New Galloway, Scotland.ââI consider it the most
valuable medicine known.â

G. HAYWARD, Esq., Surgeon, Stow-on-ye-Wold.ââI am now using DR. J. COLLIS
BROWNEâS CHLORODYNE with marvellous good effects in allaying inveterate
sickness in pregnancy.â

DR. MâGRIGOR CROFT, late Army Staff, says: âIt is a most valuable
medicine.â

J. C. BAKER, Esq., M.D., Bideford: âIt is without doubt the most valuable
and certain anodyne we have.â

DR. GIBBON, Army Medical Staff, Calcutta: âTwo doses completely cured me
of DiarrhÅa.â

From G. V. RIDOUT, Esq., Surgeon, Egham: âAs an astringent in severe
DiarrhÅa, and an anti-spasmodic in Colic, with Cramps in the Abdomen, the
relief is instantaneous.  As a sedative in Neuralgia and Tic-Doloreux,
its effects were very remarkable.  In Uterine Affections I have found it
extremely valuable.â

                                * * * * *

_CAUTION_.â_Beware of Spurious Compounds_, _or Imitations of_
â_Chlorodyne_.â  _Dr. Browne placed the Recipe for making_ â_Chlorodyne_â
_in the hands of Mr. Davenport ONLY_; _consequently there can be no other
Manufacturer_.  _The genuine bears the words_ â_Dr. J. Collis Browneâs
Chlorodyne_â _on the Government Stamp of each Bottle_.

the agent, in a manner which would meet the approbation of
all.ââ_Lancet_, _June_ 1_st_, 1861.

has been too common at other baths.ââ_Med. Times_, _May_ 25_th_, 1861.

Bath is the Bath of Health, the high temperature Baths the Bath of the

of the Metropolis, that Messrs. POLLARDâS Baths are far superior to any I
