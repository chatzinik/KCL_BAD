Book 60 1 Peter
001:001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen
        ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion
        in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
001:002 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification
        of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled
        with his blood:  Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        who according to his great mercy became our father again
        to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
        from the dead,
001:004 to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't
        fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,
001:005 who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation
        ready to be revealed in the last time.
001:006 Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while,
        if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,
001:007 that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold
        that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found
        to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation
        of Jesus Christ--
001:008 whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you
        don't see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy
        unspeakable and full of glory--
001:009 receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
001:010 Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched
        diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,
001:011 searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ,
        which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings
        of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.
001:012 To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you,
        they ministered these things, which now have been announced
        to you through those who preached the Good News to you
        by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels
        desire to look into.
001:013 Therefore, prepare your minds for action,{literally, "gird up
        the waist of your mind"} be sober and set your hope fully
        on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation
        of Jesus Christ--
001:014 as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according
        to your former lusts as in your ignorance,
001:015 but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be
        holy in all of your behavior;
001:016 because it is written, "You shall be holy; for I
        am holy."{Leviticus 11:44-45}
001:017 If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons
        judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your
        living as foreigners here in reverent fear:
001:018 knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things,
        with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed
        down from your fathers,
001:019 but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb,
        the blood of Christ;
001:020 who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world,
        but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,
001:021 who through him are believers in God, who raised him from
        the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope
        might be in God.
001:022 Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to
        the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection,
        love one another from the heart fervently:
001:023 having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
        through the word of God, which lives and remains forever.
001:024 For, "All flesh is like grass, and all of man's glory like the
        flower in the grass.  The grass withers, and its flower falls;
001:025 but the Lord's word endures forever."{Isaiah 40:6-8} This
        is the word of Good News which was preached to you.
002:001 Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies,
        envies, and all evil speaking,
002:002 as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word,
        that you may grow thereby,
002:003 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
002:004 coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men,
        but chosen by God, precious.
002:005 You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house,
        to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
        acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
002:006 Because it is contained in Scripture, "Behold, I lay
        in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious:
        He who believes in him will not be disappointed."{Isaiah 28:16}
002:007 For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who
        are disobedient, "The stone which the builders rejected,
        has become the chief cornerstone,"{Psalm 118:22}
002:008 and, "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense."{Isaiah
        8:14} For they stumble at the word, being disobedient,
        to which also they were appointed.
002:009 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
        a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim
        the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into
        his marvelous light:
002:010 who in time past were no people, but now are God's people,
        who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
002:011 Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain
        from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
002:012 having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they
        speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works,
        which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.
002:013 Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for
        the Lord's sake:  whether to the king, as supreme;
002:014 or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers
        and for praise to those who do well.
002:015 For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put
        to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
002:016 as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness,
        but as bondservants of God.
002:017 Honor all men.  Love the brotherhood.  Fear God.
        Honor the king.
002:018 Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear;
        not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.
002:019 For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly,
        because of conscience toward God.
002:020 For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating?
        But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering,
        this is commendable with God.
002:021 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us,
        leaving you{TR reads "us" instead of "you"} an example,
        that you should follow his steps,
002:022 who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."{Isaiah 53:9}
002:023 Who, when he was cursed, didn't curse back.  When he suffered,
        didn't threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;
002:024 who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree,
        that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness;
        by whose stripes you were healed.
002:025 For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to
        the Shepherd and Overseer{"Overseer" is from the Greek episkopon,
        which can mean overseer, curator, guardian, or superintendent.}
        of your souls.
003:001 In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
        so that, even if any don't obey the Word, they may be won
        by the behavior of their wives without a word;
003:002 seeing your pure behavior in fear.
003:003 Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding
        the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting
        on fine clothing;
003:004 but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible
        adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight
        of God very precious.
003:005 For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also
        adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
003:006 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you
        now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
003:007 You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according
        to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel,
        as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your
        prayers may not be hindered.
003:008 Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as
        brothers, tenderhearted, courteous,
003:009 not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling;
        but instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called,
        that you may inherit a blessing.
003:010 For, "He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep
        his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.
003:011 Let him turn away from evil, and do good.  Let him seek peace,
        and pursue it.
003:012 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears
        open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against
        those who do evil."{Psalm 34:12-16}
003:013 Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators
        of that which is good?
003:014 But even if you should suffer for righteousness'
        sake, you are blessed.  "Don't fear what they fear,
        neither be troubled."{Isaiah 8:12}
003:015 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be ready
        to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning
        the hope that is in you, with humility and fear:
003:016 having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against
        as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good
        manner of life in Christ.
003:017 For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing
        well than for doing evil.
003:018 Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous
        for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God;
        being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
003:019 in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,
003:020 who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently
        in the days of Noah, while the ark was being built.
        In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
003:021 This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you--
        not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer
        of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection
        of Jesus Christ,
003:022 who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven,
        angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.
004:001 Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh,
        arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered
        in the flesh has ceased from sin;
004:002 that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh
        for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
004:003 For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire
        of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts,
        drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.
004:004 They think it is strange that you don't run with them into
        the same excess of riot, blaspheming:
004:005 who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living
        and the dead.
004:006 For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead,
        that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh,
        but live as to God in the spirit.
004:007 But the end of all things is near.  Therefore be of sound mind,
        self-controlled, and sober in prayer.
004:008 And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves,
        for love covers a multitude of sins.
004:009 Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
004:010 As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another,
        as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.
004:011 If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God.
        If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies,
        that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
        to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever.  Amen.
004:012 Beloved, don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has
        come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing
        happened to you.
004:013 But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice;
        that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice
        with exceeding joy.
004:014 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed;
        because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
        On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.
004:015 For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief,
        or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters.
004:016 But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not
        be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.
004:017 For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household
        of God.  If it begins first with us, what will happen
        to those who don't obey the Good News of God?
004:018 "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen
        to the ungodly and the sinner?"{Proverbs 11:31}
004:019 Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will
        of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to
        a faithful Creator.
005:001 I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness
        of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory
        that will be revealed.
005:002 Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising
        the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily,
        not for dishonest gain, but willingly;
005:003 neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you,
        but making yourselves examples to the flock.
005:004 When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown
        of glory that doesn't fade away.
005:005 Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder.
        Yes, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to subject
        yourselves to one another; for "God resists the proud,
        but gives grace to the humble."{Proverbs 3:34}
005:006 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,
        that he may exalt you in due time;
005:007 casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.
005:008 Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful.  Your adversary
        the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom
        he may devour.
005:009 Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers
        who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.
005:010 But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal
        glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while,
        perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
005:011 To him be the glory and the power forever and ever.  Amen.
005:012 Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him,
        I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying
        that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
005:013 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you;
        and so does Mark, my son.
005:014 Greet one another with a kiss of love.  Peace be to you all
        who are in Christ Jesus.  Amen.
