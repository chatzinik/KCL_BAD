Book 52 1 Thessalonians
001:001 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians
        in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  Grace to you
        and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
001:002 We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you
        in our prayers,
001:003 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor
        of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ,
        before our God and Father.
001:004 We know, brothers{The word for "brothers" here and where context
        allows may also be correctly translated "brothers and sisters"
        or "siblings."} loved by God, that you are chosen,
001:005 and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also
        in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance.
        You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among
        you for your sake.
001:006 You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received
        the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,
001:007 so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia
        and in Achaia.
001:008 For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only
        in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith
        toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.
001:009 For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception
        we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols,
        to serve a living and true God,
001:010 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from
        the dead--Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
002:001 For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you wasn't in vain,
002:002 but having suffered before and been shamefully treated,
        as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell
        you the Good News of God in much conflict.
002:003 For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness,
        nor in deception.
002:004 But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted
        with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God,
        who tests our hearts.
002:005 For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery,
        as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),
002:006 nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others),
        when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
002:007 But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother cherishes
        her own children.
002:008 Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased
        to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our
        own souls, because you had become very dear to us.
002:009 For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail;
        for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you,
        we preached to you the Good News of God.
002:010 You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly
        we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.
002:011 As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you,
        as a father does his own children,
002:012 to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls
        you into his own Kingdom and glory.
002:013 For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that,
        when you received from us the word of the message of God,
        you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth,
        the word of God, which also works in you who believe.
002:014 For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God
        which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered
        the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did
        from the Jews;
002:015 who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets,
        and drove us out, and didn't please God, and are contrary
        to all men;
002:016 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved;
        to fill up their sins always.  But wrath has come on them
        to the uttermost.
002:017 But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season,
        in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face
        with great desire,
002:018 because we wanted to come to you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again--
        but Satan hindered us.
002:019 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?
        Isn't it even you, before our Lord Jesus{TR adds "Christ"}
        at his coming?
002:020 For you are our glory and our joy.
003:001 Therefore, when we couldn't stand it any longer, we thought
        it good to be left behind at Athens alone,
003:002 and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the
        Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you
        concerning your faith;
003:003 that no one be moved by these afflictions.  For you know
        that we are appointed to this task.
003:004 For most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand
        that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened,
        and you know.
003:005 For this cause I also, when I couldn't stand it any longer,
        sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any
        means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have
        been in vain.
003:006 But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought
        us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good
        memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long
        to see you;
003:007 for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all
        our distress and affliction through your faith.
003:008 For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.
003:009 For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you,
        for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes
        before our God;
003:010 night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face,
        and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
003:011 Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
        direct our way to you;
003:012 and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
        toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,
003:013 to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness
        before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
        with all his saints.
004:001 Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus,
        that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to
        please God, that you abound more and more.
004:002 For you know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
004:003 For this is the will of God:  your sanctification, that you
        abstain from sexual immorality,
004:004 that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own
        vessel in sanctification and honor,
004:005 not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;
004:006 that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother
        or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger
        in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
004:007 For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
004:008 Therefore he who rejects this doesn't reject man, but God,
        who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.
004:009 But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write
        to you.  For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,
004:010 for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in
        all Macedonia.  But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound
        more and more;
004:011 and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life,
        and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands,
        even as we charged you;
004:012 that you may walk properly toward those who are outside,
        and may have need of nothing.
004:013 But we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those
        who have fallen asleep, so that you don't grieve like the rest,
        who have no hope.
004:014 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God
        will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
004:015 For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive,
        who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede
        those who have fallen asleep.
004:016 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
        with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet.
        The dead in Christ will rise first,
004:017 then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together
        with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.
        So we will be with the Lord forever.
004:018 Therefore comfort one another with these words.
005:001 But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have
        no need that anything be written to you.
005:002 For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes
        like a thief in the night.
005:003 For when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction
        will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman;
        and they will in no way escape.
005:004 But you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should
        overtake you like a thief.
005:005 You are all children of light, and children of the day.
        We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness,
005:006 so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch
        and be sober.
005:007 For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk
        are drunk in the night.
005:008 But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on
        the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet,
        the hope of salvation.
005:009 For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining
        of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
005:010 who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
        together with him.
005:011 Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up,
        even as you also do.
005:012 But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you,
        and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,
005:013 and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake.
        Be at peace among yourselves.
005:014 We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage
        the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.
005:015 See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always
        follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.
005:016 Rejoice always.
005:017 Pray without ceasing.
005:018 In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God
        in Christ Jesus toward you.
005:019 Don't quench the Spirit.
005:020 Don't despise prophesies.
005:021 Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.
005:022 Abstain from every form of evil.
005:023 May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely.
        May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless
        at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
005:024 He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
005:025 Brothers, pray for us.
005:026 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
005:027 I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read
        to all the holy brothers.
005:028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  Amen.
